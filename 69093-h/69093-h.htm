<h2>PREFACE TO THIS EDITION.</h2>
<hr class="one" />
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> Chapters now offered to the Reader were formerly
published as a portion of <i>The Philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences, founded upon their History</i>: but the nature and
subject of these Chapters are more exactly described by the
present title, <i>The History of Scientific Ideas</i>. For
this part of the work is mainly historical, and was, in
fact, collected from the body of scientific literature, at
the same time that the <i>History of the Inductive
Sciences</i> was so collected. The present work contains the
history of Science so far as it depends on <em>Ideas</em>;
the former work contains the same history so far as it is
derived from <em>Observation</em>. The leading features in
<em>that</em> were Theories inferred from Facts; the leading
features of <em>this</em> are Discussions of Theories
tending to make them consistent with the conditions of human
thought.</p>
<p>The Ideas of which the History is here given are mainly the
following:<br/>
<i>Space</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Number</i>, <i>Motion</i>,
<i>Cause</i>, <i>Force</i>, <i>Matter</i>, <i>Medium</i>,
<i>Intensity</i>, <i>Scale</i>, <i>Polarity</i>,
<i>Element</i>, <i>Affinity</i>, <i>Substance</i>,
<i>Atom</i>, <i>Symmetry</i>, <i>Likeness</i>, <i>Natural
Classes</i>, <i>Species</i>, <i>Life</i>, <i>Function</i>,
<i>Vital Forces</i>, <i>Final</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1pagevi">vi</a></span> <i>Causes</i>,
<i>Historical Causation</i>, <i>Catastrophe and
Uniformity</i>, <i>First Cause</i>.</p>
<p>The controversies to which the exact fixation of these Ideas
and their properties have given occasion form a large and
essential part of the History of Science: but they also form
an important part of the Philosophy of Science, for no
Philosophy of Science can be complete which does not solve
the difficulties, antitheses, and paradoxes on which such
controversies have turned. I have given a survey of such
controversies, generally carried from their earliest origin
to their latest aspect; and have stated what appeared to me
the best solution of each problem. This has necessarily
involved me in much thorny metaphysics; but such metaphysics
is a necessary part of the progress of Science. The human
mind deriving its knowledge of Truth from the observation of
nature, cannot evade the task of determining at every step
how Truth is consistent with itself. This is the Metaphysics
of Progressive Knowledge, and this is the matter of this
present History.</p>
<p>Of the remaining part of what was formerly published as the
Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, an additional part,
described in the Introduction to the present work, will
shortly be published.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE Philosophy of Science</span>, if the phrase were to be
understood in the comprehensive sense which most naturally
offers itself to our thoughts, would imply nothing less than
a complete insight into the essence and conditions of all
real knowledge, and an exposition of the best methods for
the discovery of new truths. We must narrow and lower this
conception, in order to mould it into a form in which we may
make it the immediate object of our labours with a good hope
of success; yet still it may be a rational and useful
undertaking, to endeavour to make some advance towards such
a Philosophy, even according to the most ample conception of
it which we can form. The present work has been written with
a view of contributing, in some measure, however small it
may be, towards such an undertaking.</p>
<p>But in this, as in every attempt to advance beyond the
position which we at present occupy, our hope of success
must depend mainly upon our being able to profit, to the
fullest extent, by the progress already made. We may best
hope to understand the nature and conditions of real
knowledge, by studying the nature and conditions of the most
certain and stable portions of knowledge which we already
possess: and we are most likely to learn the best methods of
discovering truth, by examining how truths, now universally
recognized, have really been discovered. Now there do exist
among us doctrines of solid and acknowledged certainty, and
truths of which the discovery has been received with
universal applause. These constitute what we commonly term
<i>Sciences</i>; and of these bodies of exact and enduring
knowledge, we have within our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page4">4</a></span> reach so large and varied
a collection, that we may examine them, and the history of
their formation, with a good prospect of deriving from the
study such instruction as we seek. We may best hope to make
some progress towards the Philosophy of Science, by
employing ourselves upon <span class="sc">The Philosophy of the Sciences</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>Sciences</i> to which the name is most commonly and
unhesitatingly given, are those which are concerned about
the material world; whether they deal with the celestial
bodies, as the sun and stars, or the earth and its products,
or the elements; whether they consider the differences which
prevail among such objects, or their origin, or their mutual
operation. And in all these Sciences it is familiarly
understood and assumed, that their doctrines are obtained by
a common process of collecting general truths from
particular observed facts, which process is termed
<i>Induction</i>. It is further assumed that both in these
and in other provinces of knowledge, so long as this process
is duly and legitimately performed, the results will be real
substantial truth. And although this process, with the
conditions under which it is legitimate, and the general
laws of the formation of Sciences, will hereafter be
subjects of discussion in this work, I shall at present so
far adopt the assumption of which I speak, as to give to the
Sciences from which our lessons are to be collected the name
of <i>Inductive Sciences</i>. And thus it is that I am led
to designate my work as <span class="sc">The Philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences</span>.</p>
<p>The views respecting the nature and progress of knowledge,
towards which we shall be directed by such a course of
inquiry as I have pointed out, though derived from those
portions of human knowledge which are more peculiarly and
technically termed <i>Sciences</i>, will by no means be
confined, in their bearing, to the domain of such Sciences
as deal with the material world, nor even to the whole range
of Sciences now existing. On the contrary, we shall be led
to believe that the nature of truth is in all subjects the
same, and that its discovery involves, in all cases, the
like <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page5">5</a></span> conditions. On one subject of human speculation
after another, man’s knowledge assumes that exact and
substantial character which leads us to term it
<i>Science</i>; and in all these cases, whether inert matter
or living bodies, whether permanent relations or successive
occurrences, be the subject of our attention, we can point
out certain universal characters which belong to truth,
certain general laws which have regulated its progress among
men. And we naturally expect that, even when we extend our
range of speculation wider still, when we contemplate the
world within us as well as the world without us, when we
consider the thoughts and actions of men as well as the
motions and operations of unintelligent bodies, we shall
still find some general analogies which belong to the
essence of truth, and run through the whole intellectual
universe. Hence we have reason to trust that a just
Philosophy of the Sciences may throw light upon the nature
and extent of our knowledge in every department of human
speculation. By considering what is the real import of our
acquisitions, where they are certain and definite, we may
learn something respecting the difference between true
knowledge and its precarious or illusory semblances; by
examining the steps by which such acquisitions have been
made, we may discover the conditions under which truth is to
be obtained; by tracing the boundary-line between our
knowledge and our ignorance, we may ascertain in some
measure the extent of the powers of man’s understanding.</p>
<p>But it may be said, in such a design there is nothing new;
these are objects at which inquiring men have often before
aimed. To determine the difference between real and
imaginary knowledge, the conditions under which we arrive at
truth, the range of the powers of the human mind, has been a
favourite employment of speculative men from the earliest to
the most recent times. To inquire into the original,
certainty, and compass of man’s knowledge, the limits of his
capacity, the strength and weakness of his reason, has been
the professed purpose of many of the most conspicuous and
valued labours of the philosophers of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page6">6</a></span> all periods up to
our own day. It may appear, therefore, that there is little
necessity to add one more to these numerous essays; and
little hope that any new attempt will make any very
important addition to the stores of thought upon such
questions, which have been accumulated by the profoundest
and acutest thinkers of all ages.</p>
<p>To this I reply, that without at all disparaging the value
or importance of the labours of those who have previously
written respecting the foundations and conditions of human
knowledge, it may still be possible to add something to what
they have done. The writings of all great philosophers, up
to our own time, form a series which is not yet terminated.
The books and systems of philosophy which have, each in its
own time, won the admiration of men, and exercised a
powerful influence upon their thoughts, have had each its
own part and functions in the intellectual history of the
world; and other labours which shall succeed these may also
have their proper office and useful effect. We may not be
able to do much, and yet still it may be in our power to
effect something. Perhaps the very advances made by former
inquirers may have made it possible for us, at present, to
advance still further. In the discovery of truth, in the
development of man’s mental powers and privileges, each
generation has its assigned part; and it is for us to
endeavour to perform our portion of this perpetual task of
our species. Although the terms which describe our
undertaking may be the same which have often been employed
by previous writers to express their purpose, yet our
position is different from theirs, and thus the result may
be different too. We have, as they had, to run our
appropriate course of speculation with the exertion of our
best powers; but our course lies in a more advanced part of
the great line along which Philosophy travels from age to
age. However familiar and old, therefore, be the design of
such a work as this, the execution may have, and if it be
performed in a manner suitable to the time, will have,
something that is new and not unimportant. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page7">7</a></span></p>
<p>Indeed, it appears to be absolutely necessary, in order
to check the prevalence of grave and pernicious errour, that
the doctrines which are taught concerning the foundations of
human knowledge and the powers of the human mind, should be
from time to time revised and corrected or extended.
Erroneous and partial views are promulgated and accepted;
one portion of the truth is insisted upon to the undue
exclusion of another; or principles true in themselves are
exaggerated till they produce on men’s minds the effect of
falsehood. When evils of this kind have grown to a serious
height, a <em>Reform</em> is requisite. The faults of the
existing systems must be remedied by correcting what is
wrong, and supplying what is wanting. In such cases, all the
merits and excellencies of the labours of the preceding
times do not supersede the necessity of putting forth new
views suited to the emergency which has arrived. The new
form which errour has assumed makes it proper to endeavour
to give a new and corresponding form to truth. Thus the mere
progress of time, and the natural growth of opinion from one
stage to another, leads to the production of new systems and
forms of philosophy. It will be found, I think, that some of
the doctrines now most widely prevalent respecting the
foundations and nature of truth are of such a kind that a
Reform is needed. The present age seems, by many
indications, to be called upon to seek a sounder Philosophy
of Knowledge than is now current among us. To contribute
towards such a Philosophy is the object of the present work.
The work is, therefore, like all works which take into
account the most recent forms of speculative doctrine,
invested with a certain degree of novelty in its aspect and
import, by the mere time and circumstances of its
appearance.</p>
<p>But, moreover, we can point out a very important peculiarity
by which this work is, in its design, distinguished from
preceding essays on like subjects; and this difference
appears to be of such a kind as may well entitle us to
expect some substantial addition to our knowledge as the
result of our labours. The peculiarity <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page8">8</a></span> of which I speak
has already been announced;&#8212;it is this: that we purpose to
collect our doctrines concerning the nature of knowledge,
and the best mode of acquiring it, from a contemplation of
the Structure and History of those Sciences (the Material
Sciences), which are universally recognized as the clearest
and surest examples of knowledge and of discovery. It is by
surveying and studying the whole mass of such Sciences, and
the various steps of their progress, that we now hope to
approach to the true Philosophy of Science.</p>
<p>Now this, I venture to say, is a new method of pursuing the
philosophy of human knowledge. Those who have hitherto
endeavoured to explain the nature of knowledge, and the
process of discovery, have, it is true, often illustrated
their views by adducing special examples of truths which
they conceived to be established, and by referring to the
mode of their establishment. But these examples have, for
the most part, been taken at random, not selected according
to any principle or system. Often they have involved
doctrines so precarious or so vague that they confused
rather than elucidated the subject; and instead of a single
difficulty,&#8212;What is the nature of Knowledge? these
attempts at illustration introduced two,&#8212;What was the true
analysis of the Doctrines thus adduced? and,&#8212;Whether they
might safely be taken as types of real Knowledge?</p>
<p>This has usually been the case when there have been adduced,
as standard examples of the formation of human knowledge,
doctrines belonging to supposed sciences other than the
material sciences; doctrines, for example, of Political
Economy, or Philology, or Morals, or the Philosophy of the
Fine Arts. I am very far from thinking that, in regard to
such subjects, there are no important truths hitherto
established: but it would seem that those truths which have
been obtained in these provinces of knowledge, have not yet
been fixed by means of distinct and permanent phraseology,
and sanctioned by universal reception, and formed into a
connected system, and traced through the steps of their
gradual discovery and establishment, so as to make <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page9">9</a></span> them
instructive examples of the nature and progress of truth in
general. Hereafter we trust to be able to show that the
progress of moral, and political, and philological, and
other knowledge, is governed by the same laws as that of
physical science. But since, at present, the former class of
subjects are full of controversy, doubt, and obscurity,
while the latter consist of undisputed truths clearly
understood and expressed, it may be considered a wise
procedure to make the latter class of doctrines the basis of
our speculations. And on the having taken this course, is,
in a great measure, my hope founded, of obtaining valuable
truths which have escaped preceding inquirers.</p>
<p>But it may be said that many preceding writers on the nature
and progress of knowledge have taken their examples
abundantly from the Physical Sciences. It would be easy to
point out admirable works, which have appeared during the
present and former generations, in which instances of
discovery, borrowed from the Physical Sciences, are
introduced in a manner most happily instructive. And to the
works in which this has been done, I gladly give my most
cordial admiration. But at the same time I may venture to
remark that there still remains a difference between my
design and theirs: and that I use the Physical Sciences as
exemplifications of the general progress of knowledge in a
manner very materially different from the course which is
followed in works such as are now referred to. For the
conclusions stated in the present work, respecting knowledge
and discovery, are drawn from <em>a connected and systematic
survey of the whole range of Physical Science and its
History</em>; whereas, hitherto, philosophers have contented
themselves with adducing detached examples of scientific
doctrines, drawn from one or two departments of science. So
long as we select our examples in this arbitrary and limited
manner, we lose the best part of that philosophical
instruction, which the sciences are fitted to afford when we
consider them as all members of one series, and as governed
by rules which are the same for all. Mathematical and
chemical truths, physical and physiological doctrines, the
sciences of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page10">10</a></span> classification and of causation, must alike
be taken into our account, in order that we may learn what
are the general characters of real knowledge. When our
conclusions assume so comprehensive a shape that they apply
to a range of subjects so vast and varied as these, we may
feel some confidence that they represent the genuine form of
universal and permanent truth. But if our exemplification is
of a narrower kind, it may easily cramp and disturb our
philosophy. We may, for instance, render our views of truth
and its evidence so rigid and confined as to be quite
worthless, by founding them too much on the contemplation of
mathematical truth. We may overlook some of the most
important steps in the general course of discovery, by
fixing our attention too exclusively upon some one
conspicuous group of discoveries, as, for instance, those of
Newton. We may misunderstand the nature of physiological
discoveries, by attempting to force an analogy between them
and discoveries of mechanical laws, and by not attending to
the intermediate sciences which fill up the vast interval
between these extreme terms in the series of material
sciences. In these and in many other ways, a partial and
arbitrary reference to the material sciences in our inquiry
into human knowledge may mislead us; or at least may fail to
give us those wider views, and that deeper insight, which
should result from a systematic study of the whole range of
sciences with this particular object.</p>
<p>The design of the following work, then, is to form a
Philosophy of Science, by analyzing the substance and
examining the progress of the existing body of the sciences.
As a preliminary to this undertaking, a survey of the
history of the sciences was necessary. This, accordingly, I
have already performed; and the result of the labour thus
undertaken has been laid before the public as a <i>History
of the Inductive Sciences</i>.</p>
<p>In that work I have endeavoured to trace the steps by which
men acquired each main portion of that knowledge on which
they now look with so much confidence and satisfaction. The
events which that History relates, the speculations and
controversies <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page11">11</a></span> which are there described, and
discussions of the same kind, far more extensive, which are
there omitted, must all be taken into our account at
present, as the prominent and standard examples of the
circumstances which attend the progress of knowledge. With
so much of real historical fact before us, we may hope to
avoid such views of the processes of the human mind as are
too partial and limited, or too vague and loose, or too
abstract and unsubstantial, to represent fitly the real
forms of discovery and of truth.</p>
<p>Of former attempts, made with the same view of tracing the
conditions of the progress of knowledge, that of Bacon is
perhaps the most conspicuous: and his labours on this
subject were opened by his book on the <i>Advancement of
Learning</i>, which contains, among other matter, a survey
of the then existing state of knowledge. But this review was
undertaken rather with the object of ascertaining in what
quarters future advances were to be hoped for, than of
learning by what means they were to be made. His examination
of the domain of human knowledge was conducted rather with
the view of discovering what remained undone, than of
finding out how so much had been done. Bacon’s survey was
made for the purpose of tracing the boundaries, rather than
of detecting the principles of knowledge. ‘I will now
attempt,’ he says<a id="fnanchor1-I" href="#note1-I"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>, ‘to make a general and faithful
perambulation of learning, with an inquiry what parts
thereof lie fresh and waste, and not improved and converted
by the industry of man; to the end that such a plot made and
recorded to memory, may both minister light to any public
designation, and also serve to excite voluntary endeavours.’
Nor will it be foreign to our scheme also hereafter to
examine with a like purpose the frontier-line of man’s
intellectual estate. But the object of our perambulation in
the first place, is not so much to determine the extent of
the field, as the sources of its fertility. We would learn
by what plan and rules <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page12">12</a></span> of culture, conspiring with the
native forces of the bounteous soil, those rich harvests
have been produced which fill our garners. Bacon’s maxims,
on the other hand, respecting the mode in which he conceived
that knowledge was thenceforth to be cultivated, have little
reference to the failures, still less to the successes,
which are recorded in his Review of the learning of his
time. His precepts are connected with his historical views
in a slight and unessential manner. His Philosophy of the
Sciences is not collected from the Sciences which are
noticed in his survey. Nor, in truth, could this, at the
time when he wrote, have easily been otherwise. At that
period, scarce any branch of physics existed as a science,
except Astronomy. The rules which Bacon gives for the
conduct of scientific researches are obtained, as it were,
by divination, from the contemplation of subjects with
regard to which no sciences as yet were. His instances of
steps rightly or wrongly made in this path, are in a great
measure cases of his own devising. He could not have
exemplified his Aphorisms by references to treatises then
extant, on the laws of nature; for the constant burden of
his exhortation is, that men up to his time had almost
universally followed an erroneous course. And however we may
admire the sagacity with which he pointed the way along a
better path, we have this great advantage over him;&#8212;that we
can interrogate the many travellers who since his time have
journeyed on this road. At the present day, when we have
under our notice so many sciences, of such wide extent, so
well established; a Philosophy of the Sciences ought, it
must seem, to be founded, not upon conjecture, but upon an
examination of many instances;&#8212;should not consist of a few
vague and unconnected maxims, difficult and doubtful in
their application, but should form a system of which every
part has been repeatedly confirmed and verified.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-I" href="#fnanchor1-I">1</a></span> <i>Advancement of Learning</i>, b. i. p. 74.</div>
<p>This accordingly it is the purpose of the present work to
attempt. But I may further observe, that as my hope of
making any progress in this undertaking is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page13">13</a></span> founded upon
the design of keeping constantly in view the whole result of
the past history and present condition of science, I have
also been led to draw my lessons from my examples in a
manner more systematic and regular, as appears to me, than
has been done by preceding writers. Bacon, as I have just
said, was led to his maxims for the promotion of knowledge
by the sagacity of his own mind, with little or no aid from
previous examples. Succeeding philosophers may often have
gathered useful instruction from the instances of scientific
truths and discoveries which they adduced, but their
conclusions were drawn from their instances casually and
arbitrarily. They took for their moral any which the story
might suggest. But such a proceeding as this cannot suffice
for us, whose aim is to obtain a consistent body of
philosophy from a contemplation of the whole of Science and
its History. For our purpose it is necessary to resolve
scientific truths into their conditions and ingredients, in
order that we may see in what manner each of these has been
and is to be provided, in the cases which we may have to
consider. This accordingly is necessarily the first part of
our task:&#8212;<em>to analyse Scientific Truth into its
Elements</em>. This attempt will occupy the earlier portion
of the present work; and will necessarily be somewhat long,
and perhaps, in many parts, abstruse and uninviting. The
risk of such an inconvenience is inevitable; for the inquiry
brings before us many of the most dark and entangled
questions in which men have at any time busied themselves.
And even if these can now be made clearer and plainer than
of yore, still they can be made so only by means of mental
discipline and mental effort. Moreover this analysis of
scientific truth into its elements contains much, both in
its principles and in its results, different from the
doctrines most generally prevalent among us in recent times:
but on that very account this analysis is an essential part
of the doctrines which I have now to lay before the reader:
and I must therefore crave his indulgence towards any
portion of it which may appear to him obscure or repulsive. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page14">14</a></span></p>
<p>There is another circumstance which may tend to make
the present work less pleasing than others on the same
subject, in the nature of the examples of human knowledge to
which I confine myself; all my instances being, as I have
said, taken from the material sciences. For the truths
belonging to these sciences are, for the most part, neither
so familiar nor so interesting to the bulk of readers as
those doctrines which belong to some other subjects. Every
general proposition concerning politics or morals at once
stirs up an interest in men’s bosoms, which makes them
listen with curiosity to the attempts to trace it to its
origin and foundation. Every rule of art or language brings
before the mind of cultivated men subjects of familiar and
agreeable thought, and is dwelt upon with pleasure for its
own sake, as well as on account of the philosophical lessons
which it may convey. But the curiosity which regards the
truths of physics or chemistry, or even of physiology or
astronomy, is of a more limited and less animated kind.
Hence, in the mode of inquiry which I have prescribed to
myself, the examples which I have to adduce will not amuse
and relieve the reader’s mind as much as they might do, if I
could allow myself to collect them from the whole field of
human knowledge. They will have in them nothing to engage
his fancy, or to warm his heart. I am compelled to detain
the listener in the chilly air of the external world, in
order that we may have the advantage of full daylight.</p>
<p>But although I cannot avoid this inconvenience, so far as it
is one, I hope it will be recollected how great are the
advantages which we obtain by this restriction. We are thus
enabled to draw all our conclusions from doctrines which are
universally allowed to be eminently certain, clear, and
definite. The portions of knowledge to which I refer are
well known, and well established among men. Their names are
familiar, their assertions uncontested. Astronomy and
Geology, Mechanics and Chemistry, Optics and Acoustics,
Botany and Physiology, are each recognized as large and
substantial collections of undoubted truths. Men are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page15">15</a></span>
wont to dwell with pride and triumph on the acquisitions of
knowledge which have been made in each of these provinces;
and to speak with confidence of the certainty of their
results. And all can easily learn in what repositories these
treasures of human knowledge are to be found. When,
therefore, we begin our inquiry from such examples, we
proceed upon a solid foundation. With such a clear ground of
confidence, we shall not be met with general assertions of
the vagueness and uncertainty of human knowledge; with the
question, What truth is, and How we are to recognize it;
with complaints concerning the hopelessness and
unprofitableness of such researches. We have, at least, a
definite problem before us. We have to examine the structure
and scheme, not of a shapeless mass of incoherent materials,
of which we doubt whether it be a ruin or a natural
wilderness, but of a fair and lofty palace, still erect and
tenanted, where hundreds of different apartments belong to a
common plan, where every generation adds something to the
extent and magnificence of the pile. The certainty and the
constant progress of science are things so unquestioned,
that we are at least engaged in an intelligible inquiry,
when we are examining the grounds and nature of that
certainty, the causes and laws of that progress.</p>
<p>To this inquiry, then, we now proceed. And in entering upon
this task, however our plan or our principles may differ
from those of the eminent philosophers who have endeavoured,
in our own or in former times, to illustrate or enforce the
philosophy of science, we most willingly acknowledge them as
in many things our leaders and teachers. Each reform must
involve its own peculiar principles, and the result of our
attempts, so far as they lead to a result, must be, in some
respects, different from those of former works. But we may
still share with the great writers who have treated this
subject before us, their spirit of hope and trust, their
reverence for the dignity of the subject, their belief in
the vast powers and boundless destiny of man. And we may
once more venture to use the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page16">16</a></span> words of hopeful
exhortation, with which the greatest of those who have
trodden this path encouraged himself and his followers when
he set out upon his way.</p>
<p>‘Concerning ourselves we speak not; but as touching the
matter which we have in hand, this we ask;&#8212;that men deem
it not to be the setting up an Opinion, but the performing
of a Work: and that they receive this as a certainty; that
we are not laying the foundations of any sect or doctrine,
but of the profit and dignity of mankind. Furthermore, that
being well disposed to what shall advantage themselves, and
putting off factions and prejudices, they take common
counsel with us, to the end that being by these our aids and
appliances freed and defended from wanderings and
impediments, they may lend their hands also to the labours
which remain to be performed: and yet further, that they be
of good hope; neither imagine to themselves this our Reform
as something of infinite dimension, and beyond the grasp of
mortal man, when in truth it is the end and true limit of
infinite errour; and is by no means unmindful of the
condition of mortality and humanity, not confiding that such
a thing can be carried to its perfect close in the space of
one single age, but assigning it as a task to a succession
of generations.’</p>
<p>[The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, according to our
view, must be founded upon the History of such Sciences;
which history we have attempted in a former work. The events
of that history may be described generally as the rise of
Theories out of Facts. But besides this, which we may term
the <em>external</em> history of Theories, there is an
internal history of Theories, namely, the series of steps by
which the human mind becomes capable of forming each Theory.
Hence to complete the History of the Sciences as derived
from Facts, we require a history of the Ideas by which such
derivation has been made possible: and thus, the <i>First
Part</i> of our Philosophy must be a <i>History of
Scientific Ideas</i>;&#8212;a labour no less historical than our
former work, and concerned with the same events; but which
has been purposely kept separate during the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page17">17</a></span> composition,
in order that it might be afterwards presented in a more
systematic form, which I have here attempted to do.</p>
<p>Scientific Ideas are the Conditions of the derivation of
Sciences from Facts: but can any method or methods be given
by which such a Derivation can be ensured, or at least,
aided? Many such methods have been proposed; of which the
most celebrated is the <i>Novum Organon</i> of Bacon, of
which the title was intended to imply that its scope goes
much beyond the <i>Organon</i> of Aristotle. With the
experience of the formation of Science which the world has
had since Bacon’s time, it does not appear presumptuous to
suppose that we can now improve or correct his methods; nor
to term such an attempt <i>Novum Organon Renovatum</i>.</p>
<p class="end">The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, then, contains
these two parts, <i>The History of Scientific Ideas</i>, and
the <i>Novum Organon Renovatum</i>.]</p>

<span class="sc">Of the Fundamental Antithesis of Philosophy.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 id="b1c1s1"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Thoughts and Things.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> order that we may do something towards determining the
nature and conditions of human knowledge, (which I have
already stated as the purpose of this work,) I shall have to
refer to an antithesis or opposition, which is familiar and
generally recognized, and in which the distinction of the
things opposed to each other is commonly considered very
clear and plain. I shall have to attempt to make this
opposition sharper and stronger than it is usually
conceived, and yet to shew that the distinction is far from
being so clear and definite as it is usually assumed to be:
I shall have to point the contrast, yet shew that the things
which are contrasted cannot be separated:&#8212;I must explain
that the antithesis is constant and essential, but yet that
there is no fixed and permanent line dividing its members. I
may thus appear, in different parts of my discussion, to be
proceeding in opposite directions, but I hope that the
reader who gives me a patient attention will see that both
steps lead to the point of view to which I wish to lead him.</p>
<p>The antithesis or opposition of which I speak is denoted,
with various modifications, by various pairs of terms: I
shall endeavour to shew the connexion of these different
modes of expression, and I will begin with that form which
is the simplest and most idiomatic. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page24">24</a></span></p>
<p>The simplest and most idiomatic expression of the antithesis
to which I refer is that in which we oppose to each other
<span class="sc">Things</span> and <span class="sc">Thoughts</span>. The opposition is familiar and plain.
Our thoughts are something which belongs to ourselves;
something which takes place within us; they are what we
think; they are actions of our minds. Things, on the
contrary, are something different from ourselves and
independent of us; something which is without us; they
<em>are</em>; we see them, touch them, and thus know that
they exist; but we do not make them by seeing or touching
them, as we make our <em>Thoughts</em> by thinking them; we
are passive, and <em>Things</em> act upon our organs of
perception.</p>
<p>Now what I wish especially to remark is this: that in all
human <span class="sc">Knowledge</span> both Thoughts and Things are concerned. In
every part of my knowledge there must be some <em>thing</em>
about which I know, and an internal act of <em>me</em> who know.
Thus, to take simple yet definite parts of our knowledge, if
I know that a solar year consists of 365 days, or a lunar
month of 30 days, I know something about the sun or the
moon; namely, that those objects perform certain revolutions
and go through certain changes, in those numbers of days;
but I count such numbers and conceive such revolutions and
changes by acts of my own thoughts. And both these elements
of my knowledge are indispensable. If there were not such
external Things as the sun and the moon I could not have any
knowledge of the progress of time as marked by them. And
however regular were the motions of the sun and moon, if I
could not count their appearances and combine their changes
into a cycle, or if I could not understand this when done by
other men, I could not know anything about a year or a
month. In the former case I might be conceived as a human
being, possessing the human powers of thinking and
reckoning, but kept in a dark world with nothing to mark the
progress of existence. The latter is the case of brute
animals, which see the sun and moon, but do not know how
many days make a month or a year, because they have not
human powers of thinking and reckoning. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page25">25</a></span></p>
<p>The two elements which are essential to our knowledge in the
above cases, are necessary to human knowledge in all cases.
In all cases, Knowledge implies a combination of Thoughts
and Things. Without this combination, it would not be
Knowledge. Without Thoughts, there could be no connexion;
without Things, there could be no reality. Thoughts and
Things are so intimately combined in our Knowledge, that we
do not look upon them as distinct. One single act of the
mind involves them both; and their contrast disappears in
their union.</p>
<p>But though Knowledge requires the union of these two
elements, Philosophy requires the separation of them, in
order that the nature and structure of Knowledge may be
seen. Therefore I begin by considering this separation. And
I now proceed to speak of another way of looking at the
antithesis of which I have spoken; and which I may, for the
reasons which I have just mentioned, call the <span class="sc">Fundamental
Antithesis of Philosophy</span>.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s2"><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Necessary and Experiential Truths.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Most</span> persons are familiar with the distinction of
<i>necessary</i> and <i>contingent</i> truths. The former
kind are Truths which cannot but be true; as that 19 and 11
make 30;&#8212;that parallelograms upon the same base and between
the same parallels are equal;&#8212;that all the angles in the
same segment of a circle are equal. The latter are Truths
which <i>it happens</i> (<i>contingit</i>) are true; but
which, for anything which we can see, might have been
otherwise; as that a lunar month contains 30 days, or that
the stars revolve in circles round the pole. The latter kind
of Truths are learnt by experience, and hence we may call
them <i>Truths of Experience</i>, or, for the sake of
convenience, <i>Experiential</i> Truths, in contrast with
Necessary Truths.</p>
<p>Geometrical propositions are the most manifest examples of
Necessary Truths. All persons who have read and understood
the elements of geometry, know that the propositions above
stated (that parallelograms <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page26">26</a></span> upon the same base and
between the same parallels are equal; that all the angles in
the same segment of a circle are equal,) are necessarily
true; not only they are true, but they <em>must be</em>
true. The meaning of the terms being understood, and the
proof being gone through, the truth of the propositions must
be assented to. We learn these propositions to be true by
demonstrations deduced from definitions and axioms; and when
we have thus learnt them, we see that they could not be
otherwise. In the same manner, the truths which concern
numbers are necessary truths: 19 and 11 not only <em>do</em> make 30,
but <em>must</em> make that number, and cannot make anything
else. In the same manner, it is a necessary truth that half
the sum of two numbers added to half their difference is
equal to the greater number.</p>
<p>It is easy to find examples of Experiential Truths;&#8212;propositions which we know to be true, but know by
experience only. We know, in this way, that salt will
dissolve in water; that plants cannot live without light;&#8212;in short, we know in this way all that we do know in
chemistry, physiology, and the material sciences in general.
I take the <i>Sciences</i> as my examples of human
knowledge, rather than the common truths of daily life, or
moral or political truths; because, though the latter are
more generally interesting, the former are much more
definite and certain, and therefore better starting-points
for our speculations, as I have already said. And we may
take elementary astronomical truths as the most familiar
examples of Experiential Truths in the domain of science.</p>
<p>With these examples, the distinction of Necessary and
Experiential Truths is, I hope, clear. The former kind, we
see to be true by thinking about them, and see that they
could not be otherwise. The latter kind, men could never
have discovered to be true without looking at them; and
having so discovered them, still no one will pretend to say
they might not have been otherwise. For aught we can see,
the astronomical truths which express the motions and
periods of the sun, moon and stars, might have been
otherwise. If we had been placed in another part of the
solar system, our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page27">27</a></span> experiential truths respecting days,
years, and the motions of the heavenly bodies, would have
been other than they are, as we know from astronomy itself.</p>
<p>It is evident that this distinction of Necessary and
Experiential Truths involves the same antithesis which we
have already considered;&#8212;the antithesis of Thoughts and
Things. Necessary Truths are derived from our own Thoughts:
Experiential truths are derived from our observation of
Things about us. The opposition of Necessary and
Experiential Truths is another aspect of the Fundamental
Antithesis of Philosophy.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s3"><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Deduction and Induction.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I have</span> already stated that geometrical truths are
established by demonstrations <em>deduced</em> from
definitions and axioms. The term <i>Deduction</i> is
specially applied to such a course of demonstration of
truths from definitions and axioms. In the case of the
parallelograms upon the same base and between the same
parallels, we prove certain triangles to be equal, by
supposing them placed so that their two bases have the same
extremities; and hence, referring to an Axiom respecting
straight lines, we infer that the bases coincide. We combine
these equal triangles with other equal spaces, and in this
way make up both the one and the other of the
parallelograms, in such a manner as to shew that they are
equal. In this manner, going on step by step, deducing the
equality of the triangles from the axiom, and the equality
of the parallelograms from that of the triangles, we travel
to the conclusion. And this process of successive deduction
is the scheme of all geometrical proof. We begin with
Definitions of the notions which we reason about, and with
Axioms, or self-evident truths, respecting these notions;
and we get, by reasoning from these, other truths which are
demonstratively evident; and from these truths again, others
of the same kind, and so on. We begin with our own Thoughts,
which supply us with Axioms to start from; and we reason
from these, till we come to propositions <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page28">28</a></span> which are
applicable to the Things about us; as for instance, the
propositions respecting circles and spheres applicable to
the motions of the heavenly bodies. This is
<i>Deduction</i>, or <i>Deductive Reasoning</i>.</p>
<p>Experiential truths are acquired in a very different way. In
order to obtain such truths, we begin with Things. In order
to learn how many days there are in a year, or in a lunar
month, we must begin by observing the sun and the moon. We
must observe their changes day by day, and try to make the
cycle of change fit into some notion of number which we
supply from our own Thoughts. We shall find that a cycle of
30 days nearly will fit the changes of phase of the
moon;&#8212;that a cycle of 365 days nearly will fit the changes
of daily motion of the sun. Or, to go on to experiential
truths of which the discovery comes within the limits of the
history of science&#8212;we shall find (as Hipparchus found) that
the unequal motion of the sun among the stars, such as
observation shews it to be, may be fitly represented by the
notion of an <i>eccentric</i>;&#8212;a circle in which the sun
has an equable annual motion, the spectator not being in the
center of the circle. Again, in the same manner, at a later
period, Kepler started from more exact observations of the
sun, and compared them with a supposed motion in a certain
ellipse; and was able to shew that, not a circle about an
eccentric point, but an ellipse, supplied the mode of
conception which truly agreed with the motion of the sun
about the earth; or rather, as Copernicus had already shewn,
of the earth about the sun. In such cases, in which truths
are obtained by beginning from observation of external
things and by finding some notion with which the Things, as
observed, agree, the truths are said to be obtained by
<i>Induction</i>. The process is an <i>Inductive Process</i>.</p>
<p>The contrast of the Deductive and Inductive process is
obvious. In the former, we proceed at each step from general
truths to particular applications of them; in the latter,
from particular observations to a general truth which
includes them. In the former case we may be said to reason
<em>downwards</em>, in the latter case, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page29">29</a></span> <em>upwards</em>;
for general notions are conceived as standing above
particulars. Necessary truths are proved, like arithmetical
sums, by adding together the portions of which they consist.
An inductive truth is proved, like the guess which answers a
riddle, by its agreeing with the facts described.
Demonstration is irresistible in its effect on the belief,
but does not produce surprize, because all the steps to the
conclusion are exhibited, before we arrive at the
conclusion. Inductive inference is not demonstrative, but it
is often more striking than demonstrative reasoning, because
the intermediate links between the particulars and the
inference are not shewn. Deductive truths are the results of
relations among our own Thoughts. Inductive truths are
relations which we discern among existing Things; and thus,
this opposition of Deduction and Induction is again an
aspect of the Fundamental Antithesis already spoken of.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s4"><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Theories and Facts.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">General</span> experiential Truths, such as we have just spoken of,
are called <i>Theories</i>, and the particular observations
from which they are collected, and which they include and
explain, are called <i>Facts</i>. Thus Hipparchus’s
doctrine, that the sun moves in an eccentric about the
earth, is <i>his Theory</i> of the Sun, or the <i>Eccentric
Theory</i>. The doctrine of Kepler, that the Earth moves in
an Ellipse about the Sun, is <i>Kepler’s Theory</i> of the
Earth, the Elliptical Theory. Newton’s doctrine that this
elliptical motion of the Earth about the Sun is produced and
governed by the Sun’s attraction upon the Earth, is the
<i>Newtonian</i> theory, the <i>Theory of Attraction</i>.
Each of these Theories was accepted, because it included,
connected and explained the <i>Facts</i>; the Facts being,
in the two former cases, the motions of the Sun as observed;
and in the other case, the elliptical motion of the Earth as
known by Kepler’s Theory. This antithesis of <i>Theory</i>
and <i>Fact</i> is included in what has just been said of
Inductive Propositions. A Theory is an Inductive
Proposition, and the Facts <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page30">30</a></span> are the particular
observations from which, as I have said, such Propositions
are inferred by Induction. The Antithesis of Theory and Fact
implies the fundamental Antithesis of Thoughts and Things;
for a Theory (that is, a true Theory) may be described as a
Thought which is contemplated distinct from Things and seen
to agree with them; while a Fact is a combination of our
Thoughts with Things in so complete agreement that we do not
regard them as separate.</p>
<p>Thus the antithesis of Theory and Fact involves the
antithesis of Thoughts and Things, but is not identical with
it. Facts involve Thoughts, for we know Facts only by
thinking about them. The Fact that the year consists of 365
days; the Fact that the month consists of 30 days, cannot be
known to us, except we have the Thoughts of Time, Number and
Recurrence. But these Thoughts are so familiar, that we have
the fact in our mind as a simple Thing without attending to
the Thought which it involves. When we mould our Thoughts
into a Theory, we consider the thought as distinct from the
Facts; but yet, though distinct, not independent of them;
for it is a true Theory, only by including and agreeing with
the Facts.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s5"><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Ideas and Sensations.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> have just seen that the antithesis of Theory and Fact,
although it involves the antithesis of Thoughts and Things,
is not identical with it. There are other modes of
expression also, which involve the same Fundamental
Antithesis, more or less modified. Of these, the pair of
words which in their relations appear to separate the
members of the antithesis most distinctly are <i>Ideas</i> and
<i>Sensations</i>. We see and hear and touch external things, and
thus perceive them by our senses; but in perceiving them, we
connect the impressions of sense according to relations of
space, time, number, likeness, cause, &amp;c. Now some at least
of these kinds of connexion, as space, time, number, may be
contemplated distinct from the things to which they are
applied; and so contemplated, I term them <i>Ideas</i>. And
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page31">31</a></span> the other element, the impressions upon our senses
which they connect, are called <i>Sensations</i>.</p>
<p>I term space, time, cause, &amp;c., <i>Ideas</i>, because they
are general relations among our sensations, apprehended by
an act of the mind, not by the senses simply. These
relations involve something beyond what the senses alone
could furnish. By the sense of sight we see various shades
and colours and shapes before us, but the <em>outlines</em> by which
they are separated into distinct objects of definite forms,
are the work of the mind itself. And again, when we conceive
visible things, not only as surfaces of a certain form, but
as <em>solid bodies</em>, placed at various distances in space, we
again exert an act of the mind upon them. When we see a body
move, we see it move in a path or <em>orbit</em>, but this orbit is
not itself seen; it is constructed by the mind. In like
manner when we see the motions of a needle towards a magnet,
we do not <em>see</em> the attraction or force which produces the
effects; but we infer the force, by having in our minds the
Idea of Cause. Such acts of thought, such <i>Ideas</i>,
enter into our perceptions of external things.</p>
<p>But though our perceptions of external things involve some
act of the mind, they must involve something else besides an
act of the mind. If we must exercise an act of thought in
order to see force exerted, or orbits described by bodies in
motion, or even in order to see bodies existing in space,
and to distinguish one kind of object from another, still
the act of thought alone does not make the Bodies. There
must be something besides, <em>on which</em> the thought is exerted.
A colour, a form, a sound, are not produced by the mind,
however they may be moulded, combined, and interpreted by
our mental acts. A philosophical poet has spoken of</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i6">
    All the world</span><br/>
  <span class="i0">Of eye and ear, both what they half create,</span><br/>
  <span class="i0">And what perceive.</span><br/>
  </div>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">But it is clear, that though they <em>half</em> create, they
do not wholly create: there must be an external world of
colour and sound to give impressions to the eye and ear, as
well as internal powers by which we perceive <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page32">32</a></span> what is
offered to our organs. The mind is in some way passive as
well as active: there are objects without as well as
faculties within;&#8212;Sensations, as well as acts of Thought.</p>
<p>Indeed this is so far generally acknowledged, that according
to common apprehension, the mind is passive <em>rather</em> than
active in acquiring the knowledge which it receives
concerning the material world. Its sensations are generally
considered more distinct than its operations. The world
without is held to be more clearly real than the faculties
within. That there is something different from ourselves,
something external to us, something independent of us,
something which no act of our minds can make or can destroy,
is held by all men to be at least as evident, as that our
minds can exert any effectual process in modifying and
appreciating the impressions made upon them. Most persons
are more likely to doubt whether the mind be always actively
applying Ideas to the objects which it perceives, than
whether it perceive them passively by means of Sensations.</p>
<p>But yet a little consideration will show us that an activity
of the mind, and an activity according to certain Ideas, is
requisite in all our knowledge of external objects. We see
objects, of various solid forms, and at various distances
from us. But we do not thus perceive them by sensation
alone. Our visual impressions cannot, of themselves, convey
to us a knowledge of solid form, or of distance from us.
Such knowledge is inferred from what we see:&#8212;inferred by
conceiving the objects as existing in space, and by applying
to them the Idea of Space. Again:&#8212;day after day passes,
till they make up a year: but we do not know that the days
are 365, except we count them; and thus apply to them our
Idea of Number. Again:&#8212;we see a needle drawn to a magnet:
but, in truth, the <em>drawing</em> is what we cannot see.
We see the needle move, and infer the attraction, by
applying to the fact our Idea of Force, as the cause of
motion. Again:&#8212;we see two trees of different kinds; but we
cannot know that they are so, except by applying to them our
Idea of the resemblance <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page33">33</a></span> and difference which makes
kinds. And thus Ideas, as well as Sensations, necessarily
enter into all our knowledge of objects: and these two words
express, perhaps more exactly than any of the pairs before
mentioned, that Fundamental Antithesis, in the union of
which, as I have said, all knowledge consists.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s6"><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>Reflexion and Sensation.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> will hereafter be my business to show what the Ideas are,
which thus enter into our knowledge; and how each Idea has
been, as a matter of historical fact, introduced into the
Science to which it especially belongs. But before I proceed
to do this, I will notice some other terms, besides the
phrases already noticed, which have a reference, more or
less direct, to the Fundamental Antithesis of Ideas and
Sensations. I will mention some of these, in order that if
they should come under the reader’s notice, he may not be
perplexed as to their bearing upon the view here presented
to him.</p>
<p>The celebrated doctrine of Locke, that all our ‘Ideas,’
(that is, in his use of the word, all our objects of
thinking,) come from Sensation or Reflexion, will naturally
occur to the reader as connected with the antithesis of
which I have been speaking. But there is a great difference
between Locke’s account of Sensation and Reflexion, and our
view of Sensation and Ideas. He is speaking of the origin of
our knowledge;&#8212;we, of its nature and composition. He is
content to say that all the knowledge which we do not
receive directly by Sensation, we obtain by Reflex Acts of
the mind, which make up his Reflexion. But we hold that
there is no Sensation without an act of the mind, and that
the mind’s activity is not only reflexly exerted upon
itself, but directly upon objects, so as to perceive in them
connexions and relations which are not Sensations. He is
content to put together, under the name of Reflexion,
everything in our knowledge which is not Sensation: we are
to attempt to analyze all that is not Sensation; not only to
say it consists of Ideas, but <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page34">34</a></span> to point out what those
Ideas are, and to show the mode in which each of them enters
into our knowledge. His purpose was, to prove that there are
no Ideas, except the reflex acts of the mind: our endeavour
will be to show that the acts of the mind, both direct and
reflex, are governed by certain Laws, which may be
conveniently termed Ideas. His procedure was, to deny that
any knowledge could be derived from the mind alone: our
course will be, to show that in every part of our most
certain and exact knowledge, those who have added to our
knowledge in every age have referred to principles which the
mind itself supplies. I do not say that my view is contrary
to his: but it is altogether different from his. If I grant
that all our knowledge comes from Sensation and Reflexion,
still my task then is only begun; for I want further to
determine, in each science, what portion comes, not from
mere Sensation, but from those Ideas by the aid of which
either Sensation or Reflexion can lead to Science.</p>
<p>Locke’s use of the word ‘idea’ is, as the reader will
perceive, different from ours. He uses the word, as he says,
which ‘serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of
the understanding when a man thinks.’ ‘I have used it,’ he
adds, ‘to express whatever is meant by <i>phantasm</i>,
<i>notion</i>, <i>species</i>, or whatever it is to which
the mind can be employed about in thinking.’ It might be
shown that this separation of the <em>mind itself</em> from
the ideal <em>objects</em> about which it is employed in
thinking, may lead to very erroneous results. But it may
suffice to observe that we use the word <i>Ideas</i>, in the
manner already explained, to express that element, supplied
by the mind itself, which must be combined with Sensation in
order to produce knowledge. For us, Ideas are not Objects of
Thought, but rather Laws of Thought. Ideas are not
synonymous with Notions; they are Principles which give to
our Notions whatever they contain of truth. But our use of
the term <i>Idea</i> will be more fully explained hereafter. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page35">35</a></span></p>
<h4 id="b1c1s7"><i>Sect.</i> 7.&#8212;<i>Subjective and Objective.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> Fundamental Antithesis of Philosophy of which I have to
speak has been brought into great prominence in the writings
of modern German philosophers, and has conspicuously formed
the basis of their systems. They have indicated this
antithesis by the terms <i>subjective</i> and
<i>objective</i>. According to the technical language of old
writers, a thing and its qualities are described as
<i>subject</i> and <i>attributes</i>; and thus a man’s
faculties and acts are attributes of which he is the
<i>subject</i>. The mind is the <i>subject</i> in which
ideas inhere. Moreover, the man’s faculties and acts are
employed upon external <i>objects</i>; and from objects all
his sensations arise. Hence the part of a man’s knowledge
which belongs to his own mind, is <i>subjective</i>: that
which flows in upon him from the world external to him, is
<i>objective</i>. And as in man’s contemplation of nature,
there is always some act of thought which depends upon
himself, and some matter of thought which is independent of
him, there is, in every part of his knowledge, a subjective
and an objective element. The combination of the two
elements, the subjective or ideal, and the objective or
observed, is necessary, in order to give us any insight into
the laws of nature. But different persons, according to
their mental habits and constitution, may be inclined to
dwell by preference upon the one or the other of these two
elements. It may perhaps interest the reader to see this
difference of intellectual character illustrated in two
eminent men of genius of modern times, Göthe and Schiller.</p>
<p>Göthe himself gives us the account to which I refer, in his
history of the progress of his speculations concerning the
Metamorphosis of Plants; a mode of viewing their structure
by which he explained, in a very striking and beautiful
manner, the relations of the different parts of a plant to
each other; as has been narrated in the <i>History of the
Inductive Sciences</i>. Göthe felt a delight in the passive
contemplation of nature, unmingled with the desire of
reasoning and theorizing; a delight such as naturally
belongs to those poets who <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page36">36</a></span> merely embody the images
which a fertile genius suggests, and do not mix with these
pictures, judgments and reflexions of their own. Schiller,
on the other hand, both by his own strong feeling of the
value of a moral purpose in poetry, and by his adoption of a
system of metaphysics in which the subjective element was
made very prominent, was well disposed to recognize fully
the authority of ideas over external impressions.</p>
<p>Göthe for a time felt a degree of estrangement towards
Schiller, arising from this contrariety in their views and
characters. But on one occasion they fell into discussion on
the study of natural history; and Göthe endeavoured to
impress upon his companion his persuasion that nature was to
be considered, not as composed of detached and incoherent
parts, but as active and alive, and unfolding herself in
each portion, in virtue of principles which pervade the
whole. Schiller objected that no such view of the objects of
natural history had been pointed out by observation, the
only guide which the natural historians recommended; and was
disposed on this account to think the whole of their study
narrow and shallow. ‘Upon this,’ says Göthe, ‘I expounded to
him, in as lively a way as I could, the metamorphosis of
plants, drawing on paper for him, as I proceeded, a diagram
to represent that general form of a plant which shows itself
in so many and so various transformations. Schiller attended
and understood; and, accepting the explanation, he said,
“This is not observation, but an idea.” I replied,’ adds
Göthe, ‘with some degree of irritation; for the point which
separated us was most luminously marked by this expression:
but I smothered my vexation, and merely said, “I was happy
to find that I had got ideas without knowing it; nay, that I
saw them before my eyes.”’ Göthe then goes on to say, that
he had been grieved to the very soul by maxims promulgated
by Schiller, that no observed fact ever could correspond
with an idea. Since he himself loved best to wander in the
domain of external observation, he had been led to look with
repugnance and hostility upon anything which professed to
depend upon ideas. ‘Yet,’ he <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page37">37</a></span> observes, ‘it occurred to
me that if my Observation was identical with his Idea, there
must be some common ground on which we might meet.’ They
went on with their mutual explanations, and became intimate
and lasting friends. ‘And thus,’ adds the poet, by means of
that mighty and interminable controversy between
<i>object</i> and <i>subject</i>, we two concluded an
alliance which remained unbroken, and produced much benefit
to ourselves and others.’</p>
<p>The general diagram of a plant, of which Göthe here speaks,
must have been a combination of lines and marks expressing
the relations of position and equivalence among the elements
of vegetable forms, by which so many of their resemblances
and differences may be explained. Such a symbol is not an
Idea in that general sense in which we propose to use the
term, but is a particular modification of the general Ideas
of symmetry, developement, and the like; and we shall
hereafter see, according to the phraseology which we shall
explain in the next chapter, how such a diagram might
express the <i>ideal conception</i> of a plant.</p>
<p>The antithesis of <i>subjective</i> and <i>objective</i> is
very familiar in the philosophical literature of Germany and
France; nor is it uncommon in any age of our own literature.
But though efforts have recently been made to give currency
among us to this phraseology, it has not been cordially
received, and has been much complained of as not of obvious
meaning. Nor is the complaint without ground: for when we
regard the mind as the <em>subject</em> in which ideas
inhere, it becomes for us an <em>object</em>, and the
antithesis vanishes. We are not so much accustomed to use
<i>subject</i> in this sense, as to make it a proper
contrast to <i>object</i>. The combination ‘<i>ideal</i> and
<i>objective</i>,’ would more readily convey to a modern
reader the opposition which is intended between the ideas of
the mind itself, and the objects which it contemplates
around it.</p>
<p>To the antitheses already noticed&#8212;Thoughts and Things;
Necessary and Experiential Truths; Deduction and Induction;
Theory and Fact; Ideas and Sensations; Reflexion and
Sensation; Subjective and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page38">38</a></span> Objective; we may add others,
by which distinctions depending more or less upon the
fundamental antithesis have been denoted. Thus we speak of
the <i>internal</i> and <i>external</i> sources of our
knowledge; of the world <i>within</i> and the world
<i>without</i> us; of <i>Man</i> and <i>Nature</i>. Some of
the more recent metaphysical writers of Germany have divided
the universe into the <i>Me</i> and <i>Not-me</i> (Ich and
Nicht-ich). Upon such phraseology we may observe, that to
have the fundamental antithesis of which we speak really
understood, is of the highest consequence to philosophy, but
that little appears to be gained by expressing it in any
novel manner. The most weighty part of the philosopher’s
task is to analyze the operations of the mind; and in this
task, it can aid us but little to call it, instead of the
<i>mind</i>, the <i>subject</i>, or the <i>me</i>.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s8"><i>Sect.</i> 8.&#8212;<i>Matter and Form.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">There</span> are some other ways of expressing, or rather of
illustrating, the fundamental antithesis, which I may
briefly notice. The antithesis has been at different times
presented by means of various images. One of the most
ancient of these, and one which is still very instructive,
is that which speaks of Sensations as the <i>Matter</i>, and
Ideas as the <i>Form</i>, of our knowledge; just as ivory is
the matter, and a cube the form, of a die. This comparison
has the advantage of showing that two elements of an
antithesis which cannot be separated in fact, may yet be
advantageously separated in our reasonings. For Matter and
Form cannot by any means be detached from each other. All
matter must have some form; all form must be the form of
some material thing. If the ivory be not a cube, it must
have a spherical or some other form. And the cube, in order
to be a cube, must be of some material;&#8212;if not of ivory, of
wood, or stone, for instance, A figure without matter is
merely a geometrical conception;&#8212;a modification of the idea
of space. Matter without figure is a mere abstract term;&#8212;a
supposed union of certain sensible qualities which, so
insulated <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page39">39</a></span> from others, cannot exist. Yet the
distinction of Matter and Form is real; and, as a subject of
contemplation, clear and plain. Nor is the distinction by
any means useless. The speculations which treat of the two
subjects, Matter and Figure, are very different. Matter is
the subject of the sciences of Mechanics and Chemistry;
Figure, of Geometry. These two classes of Sciences have
quite different sets of principles. If we refuse to consider
the Matter and the Form of bodies separately, because we
cannot exhibit Matter and Form separately, we shut the door
to all philosophy on such subjects. In like manner, though
Sensations and Ideas are necessarily united in all our
knowledge, they can be considered as distinct; and this
distinction is the basis of all philosophy concerning
knowledge.</p>
<p>This illustration of the relation of Ideas and Sensations
may enable us to estimate a doctrine which has been put
forwards at various times. In a certain school of
speculators there has existed a disposition to derive all
our Ideas from our Sensations, the term <i>Idea</i>, being,
in this school, used in its wider sense, so as to include
all modifications and limitations of our Fundamental Ideas.
The doctrines of this school have been summarily expressed
by saying that ‘Every Idea is a transformed Sensation.’ Now,
even supposing this assertion to be exactly true, we easily
see, from what has been said, how little we are likely to
answer the ends of philosophy by putting forward such a
maxim as one of primary importance. For we might say, in
like manner, that every statue is but a transformed block of
marble, or every edifice but a collection of transformed
stones. But what would these assertions avail us, if our
object were to trace the rules of art by which beautiful
statues were formed, or great works of architecture erected?
The question naturally occurs, What is the nature, the
principle, the law of this Transformation? In what faculty
resides the transforming power? What train of ideas of
beauty, and symmetry, and stability, in the mind of the
statuary or the architect, has produced those great works
which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page40">40</a></span> mankind look upon as among their most valuable
possessions;&#8212;the Apollo of the Belvidere, the Parthenon,
the Cathedral of Cologne? When this is what we want to know,
how are we helped by learning that the Apollo is of Parian
marble, or the Cathedral of basaltic stone? We must know
much more than this, in order to acquire any insight into
the principles of statuary or of architecture. In like
manner, in order that we may make any progress in the
philosophy of knowledge, which is our purpose, we must
endeavour to learn something further respecting ideas than
that they are transformed sensations, even if they were
this.</p>
<p>But, in reality, the assertion that our ideas are
transformed sensations, is erroneous as well as frivolous.
For it conveys, and is intended to convey, the opinion that
our sensations have one form which properly belongs to them;
and that, in order to become ideas, they are converted into
some other form. But the truth is, that our sensations, of
themselves, without some act of the mind, such as involves
what we have termed an Idea, have no form. We cannot see one
object without the idea of space; we cannot see two without
the idea of resemblance or difference; and space and
difference are not sensations. Thus, if we are to employ the
metaphor of Matter and Form, which is implied in the
expression to which I have referred, our sensations, from
their first reception, have their Form not <em>changed</em>,
but <em>given</em> by our Ideas. Without the relations of
thought which we here term <i>Ideas</i>, the sensations are
matter without form. Matter without form cannot exist: and
in like manner sensations cannot become perceptions of
objects, without some formative power of the mind. By the
very act of being received as perceptions, they have a
formative power exercised upon them, the operation of which
might be expressed, by speaking of them, not as
<em>transformed</em>, but simply as <em>formed</em>;&#8212;as
invested with form, instead of being the mere formless
material of perception. The word <i>inform</i>, according to
its Latin etymology, at first implied this process by which
matter is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page41">41</a></span> invested with form. Thus Virgil<a id="fnanchor1-1" href="#note1-1"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a> speaks
of the thunderbolt as <i>informed</i> by the hands of
Brontes, and Steropes, and Pyracmon. And Dryden introduces
the word in another place:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">Let others better mould the running mass</span><br/>
  <span class="i0">Of metals, or <i>inform</i> the breathing brass.</span><br/>
   </div>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">Even in this use of the word, the form is something superior
to the brute manner, and gives it a new significance and
purpose. And hence the term is again used to denote the
effect produced by an intelligent principle of a still
higher kind:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">.&#8195;  .&#8195;  .&#8195;.&#8195;  He <i>informed</i></span><br/>
  <span class="i0">This ill-shaped body with a daring soul.</span><br/>
   </div>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">And finally even the soul itself, in its original condition,
is looked upon as matter, when viewed with reference to
education and knowledge, by which it is afterwards moulded;
and hence these are, in our language, termed
<i>information</i>. If we confine ourselves to the first of
these three uses of the term, we may correct the erroneous
opinion of which we have just been speaking, and retain the
metaphor by which it is expressed, by saying, that ideas are
not <em>transformed</em>, but <em>informed</em> sensations.</p>

<h4 id="b1c1s9"><i>Sect.</i> 9.&#8212;<i>Man the Interpreter of Nature.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">There</span> is another image by which writers have represented the
acts of thought through which knowledge is obtained from the
observation of the external world. Nature is the Book, and
Man is the <em>Interpreter</em>. The facts of the external
world are marks, in which man discovers a meaning, and so
reads them. Man is the Interpreter of Nature, and Science is
the right Interpretation. And this image also is, in many
respects, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page42">42</a></span> instructive. It exhibits to us the necessity
of both elements;&#8212;the marks which man has to look at, and
the knowledge of the alphabet and language which he must
possess and apply before he can find any meaning in what he
sees. Moreover this image presents to us, as the ideal
element, an activity of the mind of that very kind which we
wish to point out. Indeed the illustration is rather an
example than a comparison of the composition of our
knowledge. The letters and symbols which are presented to
the Interpreter are really objects of sensation: the notion
of letters as signs of words, the notion of connexions among
words by which they have meaning, really are among our
Ideas;&#8212;<em>Signs</em> and <em>Meaning</em> are Ideas,
supplied by the mind, and added to all that sensation can
disclose in any collection of visible marks. The Sciences
are not figuratively, but really, Interpretations of Nature.
But this image, whether taken as example or comparison, may
serve to show both the opposite character of the two
elements of knowledge, and their necessary combination, in
order that there may be knowledge.</p>
<p>This illustration may also serve to explain another point in
the conditions of human knowledge which we shall have to
notice:&#8212;namely, the very different degrees in which, in
different cases, we are conscious of the mental act by which
our sensations are converted into knowledge. For the same
difference occurs in reading an inscription. If the
inscription were entire and plain, in a language with which
we were familiar, we should be unconscious of any mental act
in reading it. We should seem to collect its meaning by the
sight alone. But if we had to decipher an ancient
inscription, of which only imperfect marks remained, with a
few entire letters among them, we should probably make
several suppositions as to the mode of reading it, before we
found any mode which was quite successful; and thus, our
guesses, being separate from the observed facts, and at
first not fully in agreement with them, we should be clearly
aware that the conjectured meaning, on the one hand, and the
observed marks on the other, were distinct things, though
these <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page43">43</a></span> two things would become united as elements of one
act of knowledge when we had hit upon the right conjecture.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s10"><i>Sect.</i> 10.&#8212;<i>The Fundamental Antithesis
inseparable.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> illustration just referred to, as well as other ways of
considering the subject, may help us to get over a
difficulty which at first sight appears perplexing. We have
spoken of the common opposition of <em>Theory</em> and
<em>Fact</em> as important, and as involving what we have
called the Fundamental Antithesis of Philosophy. But after
all, it may be asked, Is this distinction of Theory and Fact
really tenable? Is it not often difficult to say whether a
special part of our knowledge is a Fact or a Theory? Is it a
Fact or a Theory that the stars revolve round the pole? Is
it a Fact or a Theory that the earth is a globe revolving on
its axis? Is it a Fact or a Theory that the earth travels in
an ellipse round the sun? Is it a Fact or a Theory that the
sun attracts the earth? Is it a Fact or a Theory that the
loadstone attracts the needle? In all these cases, probably
some persons would answer one way, and some persons the
other. There are many persons by whom the doctrine of the
globular form of the earth, the doctrine of the earth’s
elliptical orbit, the doctrine of the sun’s attraction on
the earth, would be called <i>theories</i>, even if they
allowed them to be true theories. But yet if each of these
propositions be true, is it not a <i>fact</i>? And even with
regard to the simpler facts, as the motion of the stars
round the pole, although this may be a Fact to one who has
watched and measured the motions of the stars, one who has
not done this, and who has only carelessly looked at these
stars from time to time, may naturally speak of the circles
which the astronomer makes them describe as Theories. It
would seem, then, that we cannot in such cases expect
general assent, if we say, <i>This is a Fact and not a
Theory</i>, or <i>This is a Theory and not a Fact</i>. And
the same is true in a vast range of cases. It would seem,
therefore, that we cannot rest any reasoning upon this
distinction of Theory <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page44">44</a></span> and Fact; and we cannot avoid
asking whether there is any real distinction in this
antithesis, and if so, what it is.</p>
<p>To this I reply: the distinction between Theory (that is,
true Theory) and Fact, is this: that in Theory the Ideas are
considered as distinct from the Facts: in Facts, though
Ideas may be involved, they are not, in our apprehension,
separated from the sensations. In a Fact, the Ideas are
applied so readily and familiarly, and incorporated with the
sensations so entirely, that we do not see <em>them</em>, we
see <em>through them</em>. A person who carefully notes the
motion of a star all night, sees the circle which it
describes, as he sees the star, though the circle is,
really, a result of his own Ideas. A person who has in his
mind the measures of different lines and countries on the
earth’s surface, and who can put them, together into one
conception, finds that they can make no figure but a
globular one: to him, the earth’s globular form is a Fact,
as much as the square form of his chamber. A person to whom
the grounds of believing the earth to travel round the sun
are as familiar as the grounds for believing the movements
of the mail-coaches in this country, looks upon the former
event as a Fact, just as he looks upon the latter events as
Facts. And a person who, knowing the Fact of the earth’s
annual motion, refers it distinctly to its mechanical cause,
conceives the sun’s attraction as a Fact, just as he
conceives as a Fact, the action of the wind which turns the
sails of a mill. He cannot <em>see</em> the force in either case; he
supplies it out of his own Ideas. And thus, a true Theory is
a Fact; a Fact is a familiar Theory. That which is a Fact
under one aspect, is a Theory under another. The most
recondite Theories when firmly established are Facts: the
simplest Facts involve something of the nature of Theory.
Theory and Fact correspond, in a certain degree, with Ideas
and Sensations, as to the nature of their opposition. But
the Facts are Facts, so far as the Ideas have been combined
with the Sensations and absorbed in them: the Theories are
Theories, so far as the Ideas are kept distinct from the
Sensations, and so far as it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page45">45</a></span> considered still a
question whether those can be made to agree with these.</p>
<p>We may, as I have said, illustrate this matter by
considering man as <em>interpreting</em> the phenomena which
he sees. He often interprets without being aware that he
does so. Thus when we see the needle move towards the
magnet, we assert that the magnet exercises an attractive
force on the needle. But it is only by an interpretative act
of our own minds that we ascribe this motion to attraction.
That, in this case, a force is exerted&#8212;something of the
nature of the pull which we could apply by our own
volition&#8212;is our interpretation of the phenomena; although
we may be conscious of the act of interpretation, and may
then regard the attraction as a Fact.</p>
<p>Nor is it in such cases only that we interpret phenomena in
our own way, without being conscious of what we do. We see a
tree at a distance, and judge it to be a chestnut or a lime;
yet this is only an inference from the colour or form of the
mass according to preconceived classifications of our own.
Our lives are full of such unconscious interpretations. The
farmer recognizes a good or a bad soil; the artist a picture
of a favourite master; the geologist a rock of a known
locality, as we recognize the faces and voices of our
friends; that is, by judgments formed on what we see and
hear; but judgments in which we do not analyze the steps, or
distinguish the inference from the appearance. And in these
mixtures of observation and inference, we speak of the
judgment thus formed, as a Fact directly observed.</p>
<p>Even in the case in which our perceptions appear to be most
direct, and least to involve any interpretations of our own,&#8212;in
the simple process of seeing,&#8212;who does not know how much
we, by an act of the mind, add to that which our senses
receive? Does any one fancy that he sees a solid cube? It is
easy to show that the solidity of the figure, the relative
position of its faces and edges to each other, are
inferences of the spectator; no more conveyed to his
conviction by the eye alone, than they would be if he were
looking at <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page46">46</a></span> a painted representation of a cube. The
scene of nature is a picture without depth of substance, no
less than the scene of art; and in the one case as in the
other, it is the mind which, by an act of its own, discovers
that colour and shape denote distance and solidity. Most men
are unconscious of this perpetual habit of reading the
language of the external world, and translating as they
read. The draughtsman, indeed, is compelled, for his
purposes, to return back in thought from the solid bodies
which he has inferred, to the shapes of surface which he
really sees. He knows that there is a mask of theory over
the whole face of nature, if it be <em>theory</em> to infer more than
we <em>see</em>. But other men, unaware of this masquerade,
hold it to be a fact that they see cubes and spheres,
spacious apartments and winding avenues. And these things
are facts to them, because they are unconscious of the
mental operation by which they have penetrated nature’s
disguise.</p>
<p>And thus, we still have an intelligible distinction of Fact
and Theory, if we consider Theory as a conscious, and Fact
as an unconscious inference, from the phenomena which are
presented to our senses.</p>
<p>But still, Theory and Fact, Inference and Perception,
Reasoning and Observation, are antitheses in none of which
can we separate the two members by any fixed and definite
line.</p>
<p>Even the simplest terms by which the antithesis is expressed
cannot be separated. Ideas and Sensations, Thoughts and
Things, Subject and Object, cannot in any case be applied
absolutely and exclusively. Our Sensations require Ideas to
bind them together, namely, Ideas of space, time, number,
and the like. If not so bound together, Sensations do not
give us any apprehension of Things or Objects. All Things,
all Objects, must exist in space and in time&#8212;must be one or
many. Now space, time, number, are not Sensations or Things.
They are something different from, and opposed to Sensations
and Things. We have termed them Ideas. It may be said they
are <i>Relations</i> of Things, or of Sensations. But
granting this form of expression, still a <i>Relation</i> is
not a Thing or a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page47">47</a></span> Sensation; and therefore we must still
have another and opposite element, along with our
Sensations. And yet, though we have thus these two elements
in every act of perception, we cannot designate any portion
of the act as absolutely and exclusively belonging to one of
the elements. Perception involves Sensation, along with
Ideas of time, space, and the like; or, if any one prefers
the expression, we may say, Perception involves Sensations
along with the apprehension of Relations. Perception is
Sensation, along with such Ideas as make Sensation into an
apprehension of Things or Objects.</p>
<p>And as Perception of Objects implies Ideas,&#8212;as Observation
implies Reasoning;&#8212;so, on the other hand, Ideas cannot
exist where Sensation has not been; Reasoning cannot go on
when there has not been previous Observation. This is
evident from the necessary order of developement of the
human faculties. Sensation necessarily exists from the first
moments of our existence, and is constantly at work.
Observation begins before we can suppose the existence of
any Reasoning which is not involved in Observation. Hence,
at whatever period we consider our Ideas, we must consider
them as having been already engaged in connecting our
Sensations, and as having been modified by this employment.
By being so employed, our Ideas are unfolded and defined;
and such developement and definition cannot be separated
from the Ideas themselves. We cannot conceive space, without
boundaries or forms; now Forms involve Sensations. We cannot
conceive time, without events which mark the course of time;
but events involve Sensations. We cannot conceive number,
without conceiving things which are numbered; and Things
imply sensations. And the forms, things, events, which are
thus implied in our Ideas, having been the objects of
Sensation constantly in every part of our life, have
modified, unfolded, and fixed our Ideas, to an extent which
we cannot estimate, but which we must suppose to be
essential to the processes which at present go on in our
minds. We cannot say that Objects create Ideas; for to
perceive Objects we must already have Ideas. But we may <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page48">48</a></span>
say, that Objects and the constant Perception of Objects
have so far modified our Ideas, that we cannot, even in
thought, separate our Ideas from the perception of Objects.</p>
<p>We cannot say of any Ideas, as of the Idea of space, or
time, or number, that they are absolutely and exclusively
Ideas. We cannot conceive what space, or time, or number,
would be in our minds, if we had never perceived any Thing
or Things in space or time. We cannot conceive ourselves in
such a condition as never to have perceived any Thing or
Things in space or time. But, on the other hand, just as
little can we conceive ourselves becoming acquainted with
space and time or numbers as objects of Sensation. We cannot
reason without having the operations of our minds affected
by previous Sensations; but we cannot conceive Reasoning to
be merely a series of Sensations. In order to be used in
Reasoning, Sensation must become Observation; and, as we
have seen, Observation already involves Reasoning. In order
to be connected by our Ideas, Sensations must be Things or
Objects, and Things or Objects already include Ideas. And
thus, none of the terms by which the fundamental antithesis
is expressed can be absolutely and exclusively applied.</p>
<p>I will make a remark suggested by the views which have thus
been presented. Since, as we have just seen, none of the
terms which express the fundamental antithesis can be
applied absolutely and exclusively, the absolute application
of the antithesis in any particular case can never be a
conclusive or immoveable principle. This remark is the more
necessary to be borne in mind, as the terms of this
antithesis are often used in a vehement and peremptory
manner. Thus we are often told that such a thing is <em>a
Fact</em>; <span class="sc">a Fact</span> and not a Theory, with all the emphasis
which, in speaking or writing, tone or italics or capitals
can give. We see from what has been said, that when this is
urged, before we can estimate the truth, or the value of the
assertion, we must ask to whom is it a Fact? what habits of
thought, what previous information, what Ideas does it
imply, to conceive the Fact as a Fact? <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page49">49</a></span> Does not the
apprehension of the Fact imply assumptions which may with
equal justice be called Theory, and which are perhaps false
Theory? in which case, the Fact is no Fact. Did not the
ancients assert it as a Fact, that the earth stood still,
and the stars moved? and can any Fact have stronger apparent
evidence to justify persons in asserting it emphatically
than this had?</p>
<p>These remarks are by no means urged in order to show that no
Fact can be certainly known to be true; but only, to show
that no Fact can be certainly shown to be a Fact, merely by
calling it a Fact, however emphatically. There is by no
means any ground of general skepticism with regard to truth,
involved in the doctrine of the necessary combination of two
elements in all our knowledge. On the contrary, Ideas are
requisite to the essence, and Things to the reality of our
knowledge in every case. The proportions of Geometry and
Arithmetic are examples of knowledge respecting our Ideas of
space and number, with regard to which there is no room for
doubt. The doctrines of Astronomy are examples of truths not
less certain respecting the Facts of the external world.</p>
<h4 id="b1c1s11"><i>Sect.</i> 11.&#8212;<i>Successive Generalization.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> the preceding pages we have been led to the doctrine,
that though, in the Antithesis of Theory and Fact, there is
involved an essential opposition; namely the opposition of
the thoughts within us and the phenomena without us; yet
that we cannot distinguish and define the members of this
antithesis separately. Theories become Facts, by becoming
certain and familiar: and thus, as our knowledge becomes
more sure and more extensive, we are constantly transferring
to the class of facts, opinions which were at first regarded
as theories.</p>
<p>Now we have further to remark, that in the progress of human
knowledge respecting any branch of speculation, there may be
several such steps in succession, each depending upon and
including the preceding. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page50">50</a></span> The theoretical views which
one generation of discoverers establishes, become the facts
from which the next generation advances to new theories. As
men rise from the particular to the general, so, in the same
manner, they rise from what is general to what is more
general. Each induction supplies the materials of fresh
inductions; each generalization, with all that it embraces
in its circle, may be found to be but one of many circles,
comprehended within the circuit of some wider
generalization.</p>
<p>This remark has already been made, and illustrated, in the
<i>History of the Inductive Sciences</i><a id="fnanchor2-1" href="#note2-1"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>; and, in
truth, the whole of the history of science is full of
suggestions and exemplifications of this course of things.
It may be convenient, however, to select a few instances
which may further explain and confirm this view of the
progress of scientific knowledge.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-1" href="#fnanchor2-1">2</a></span> <i>Hist. Inductive Sciences</i>, b. vii. c. ii.
sect. 5.</div>
<p>The most conspicuous instance of this succession is to be
found in that science which has been progressive from the
beginning of the world to our own times, and which exhibits
by far the richest collection of successive discoveries: I
mean Astronomy. It is easy to see that each of these
successive discoveries depended on those antecedently made,
and that in each, the truths which were the highest point of
the knowledge of one age were the fundamental basis of the
efforts of the age which came next. Thus we find, in the
days of Greek discovery, Hipparchus and Ptolemy combining
and explaining the particular <em>facts</em> of the motion
of the sun, moon, and planets, by means of the
<em>theory</em> of epicycles and eccentrics;&#8212;a highly
important step, which gave an intelligible connexion and
rule to the motions of each of these luminaries. When these
cycles and epicycles, thus truly representing the apparent
motions of the heavenly bodies, had accumulated to an
inconvenient amount, by the discovery of many inequalities
in the observed motions, Copernicus showed that their
effects might all be more simply included, by making the sun
the center of motion of the planets, instead of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page51">51</a></span> the
earth. But in this new view, he still retained the epicycles
and eccentrics which governed the motion of each body. Tycho
Brahe’s observations, and Kepler’s calculations, showed
that, besides the vast number of facts which the epicyclical
theory could account for, there were some which it would not
exactly include, and Kepler was led to the persuasion that
the planets move in ellipses. But this view of motion was at
first conceived by Kepler as a modification of the
conception of epicycles. On one occasion he blames himself
for not sooner seeing that such a modification was possible.
‘What an absurdity on my part!’ he cries<a id="fnanchor3-1" href="#note3-1"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>; ‘as if
libration in the diameter of the epicycle might not come to
the same thing as motion in the ellipse.’ But again;
Kepler’s <em>laws</em> of the elliptical motion of the
planets were established; and these laws immediately became
the <em>facts</em> on which the mathematicians had to found
their mechanical theories. From these facts, Newton, as we
have related, proved that the central force of the sun
retains the planets in their orbits, according to the law of
the inverse square of the distance. The same <em>law</em>
was shown to prevail in the gravitation of the earth. It was
shown, too, by induction from the motions of Jupiter and
Saturn, that the planets attract each other; by calculations
from the figure of the earth, that the parts of the earth
attract each other; and, by considering the course of the
tides, that the sun and moon attract the waters of the
ocean. And all these curious discoveries being established
as <em>facts</em>, the subject was ready for another step of
generalization. By an unparalleled rapidity in the progress
of discovery in this case, not only were all the inductions
which we have first mentioned made by one individual, but
the new advance, the higher flight, the closing victory,
fell to the lot of the same extraordinary person.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-1" href="#fnanchor3-1">3</a></span> <i>Hist. Inductive Sciences</i>, b. v. c. iv.
sect. 3.</div>
<p>The attraction of the sun upon the planets, of the moon upon
the earth, of the planets on each other, of the parts of the
earth on themselves, of the sun and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page52">52</a></span> moon upon the
ocean;&#8212;all these truths, each of itself a great discovery,
were included by Newton in the higher <i>generalization</i>,
of the universal gravitation of matter, by which each
particle is drawn to every other according to the law of the
inverse square: and thus this long advance from discovery to
discovery, from truths to truths, each justly admired when
new, and then rightly used as old, was closed in a worthy
and consistent manner, by a truth which is the most worthy
admiration, because it includes all the researches of
preceding ages of Astronomy.</p>
<p>We may take another example of a succession of this kind
from the history of a science, which, though it has made
wonderful advances, has not yet reached its goal, as
physical astronomy appears to have done, but seems to have
before it a long prospect of future progress. I now refer to
Chemistry, in which I shall try to point out how the
preceding discoveries afforded the materials of the
succeeding; although this subordination and connexion is, in
this case, less familiar to men’s minds than in Astronomy,
and is, perhaps, more difficult to present in a clear and
definite shape. Sylvius saw, in the facts which occur, when
an acid and an alkali are brought together, the evidence
that they neutralize each other. But cases of
neutralization, and acidification, and many other effects of
mixture of the ingredients of bodies, being thus viewed as
<em>facts</em>, had an aspect of unity and law given them by
Geoffroy and Bergman<a id="fnanchor4-1" href="#note4-1"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>, who introduced the
<em>conception</em> of the Chemical Affinity or Elective
Attraction, by which certain elements select other elements,
as if by preference. That combustion, whether a chemical
union or a chemical separation of ingredients, is of the
same nature with acidification, was the doctrine of Beccher
and Stahl, and was soon established as a truth which must
form a part of every succeeding physical theory. That the
rules of affinity and chemical composition may include
gaseous elements, was established by Black and Cavendish.
And all these truths, thus brought to light by <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page53">53</a></span> chemical
discoverers,&#8212;affinity, the identity of acidification and
combustion, the importance of gaseous elements,&#8212;along with
all the facts respecting the weight of ingredients and
compounds which the balance disclosed,&#8212;were taken up,
connected, and included as <em>particulars</em> in the
oxygen <em>theory</em> of Lavoisier. Again, the results of
this theory, and the quantity of the several ingredients
which entered into each compound&#8212;(such results, for the
most part, being now no longer mere theoretical
speculations, but recognized facts)&#8212;were the
<em>particulars</em> from which Dalton derived that wide law
of chemical combination which we term the Atomic
<em>Theory</em>. And this law, soon generally accepted among
chemists, is already in its turn become one of the
<em>facts</em> included in Faraday’s <em>Theory</em> of the
identity of Chemical Affinity and Electric Attraction.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to give further exemplifications of this
constant ascent from one step to a higher; this perpetual
conversion of true theories into the materials of other and
wider theories. It will hereafter be our business to
exhibit, in a more full and formal manner, the mode in which
this principle determines the whole scheme and structure of
all the most exact sciences. And thus, beginning with the
facts of sense, we gradually climb to the highest forms of
human knowledge, and obtain from experience and observation
a vast collection of the most wide and elevated truths.</p>
<p>There are, however, truths of a very different kind, to
which we must turn our attention, in order to pursue our
researches respecting the nature and grounds of our
knowledge. But before we do this, we must notice one more
feature in that progress of science which we have already in
part described.</p>

has already been stated that we gather knowledge from
the external world, when we are able to apply, to the facts
which we observe, some ideal conception, which gives unity
and connexion to multiplied and separate perceptions. We
have also shown that our conceptions, thus verified by
facts, may themselves be united and connected by a new bond
of the same nature; and that man may thus have to pursue his
way from truth to truth through a long progression of
discoveries, each resting on the preceding, and rising above
it.</p>
<p>Each of these steps, in succession, is recorded, fixed, and
made available, by some peculiar form of words; and such
words, thus rendered precise in their meaning, and
appropriated to the service of science, we may call
<i>Technical Terms</i>. It is in a great measure by
inventing such Terms that men not only best express the
discoveries they have made, but also enable their followers
to become so familiar with these discoveries, and to possess
them so thoroughly, that they can readily use them in
advancing to ulterior generalizations.</p>
<p>Most of our ideal conceptions are described by exact and
constant words or phrases, such as those of which we here
speak. We have already had occasion to employ many of these.
Thus we have had instances of technical Terms expressing
geometrical conceptions, as <i>Ellipsis</i>, <i>Radius
Vector</i>, <i>Axis</i>, <i>Plane</i>, the Proportion of the
<i>Inverse Square</i>, and the like. Other Terms have
described mechanical conceptions, as <i>Accelerating
Force</i> and <i>Attraction</i>. Again, chemistry exhibits
(as do all sciences) a series of Terms which mark the steps
of our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page55">55</a></span> progress. The views of the first real founders
of the science are recorded by the Terms which are still in
use, <i>Neutral Salts</i>, <i>Affinity</i>, and the like.
The establishment of Dalton’s theory has produced the use of
the word <i>Atom</i> in a peculiar sense, or of some other
word, as <i>Proportion</i>, in a sense equally technical.
And Mr. Faraday has found it necessary, in order to expound
his electro-chemical theory, to introduce such terms as
<i>Anode</i> and <i>Cathode</i>, <i>Anïon</i> and
<i>Cathïon</i>.</p>
<p id="b1c2s2">2. I need not adduce any further examples, for my object at
present is only to point out the use and influence of such
language: its rules and principles I shall hereafter try, in
some measure, to fix. But what we have here to remark is,
the extraordinary degree in which the progress of science is
facilitated, by thus investing each new discovery with a
compendious and steady form of expression. These terms soon
become part of the current language of all who take an
interest in speculation. However strange they may sound at
first, they soon grow familiar in our ears, and are used
without any effort, or any recollection of the difficulty
they once involved. They become as common as the phrases
which express our most frequent feelings and interests,
while yet they have incomparably more precision than belongs
to any terms which express feelings; and they carry with
them, in their import, the results of deep and laborious
trains of research. They convey the mental treasures of one
period to the generations that follow; and laden with this,
their precious freight, they sail safely across gulfs of
time in which empires have suffered shipwreck, and the
languages of common life have sunk into oblivion. We have
still in constant circulation among us the Terms which
belong to the geometry, the astronomy, the zoology, the
medicine of the Greeks, and the algebra and chemistry of the
Arabians. And we can in an instant, by means of a few words,
call to our own recollection, or convey to the apprehension
of another person, phenomena and relations of phenomena in
optics, mineralogy, chemistry, which are so complex and
abstruse, that it might seem to require the utmost subtlety
of the human mind to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page56">56</a></span> grasp them, even if that were made
the sole object of its efforts. By this remarkable effect of
Technical Language, we have the results of all the labours
of past times not only always accessible, but so prepared
that we may (provided we are careful in the use of our
instrument) employ what is really useful and efficacious for
the purpose of further success, without being in any way
impeded or perplexed by the length and weight of the chain
of past connexions which we drag along with us.</p>
<p>By such means,&#8212;by the use of the Inductive Process, and by
the aid of Technical Terms,&#8212;man has been constantly
advancing in the path of scientific truth. In a succeeding
part of this work we shall endeavour to trace the general
rules of this advance, and to lay down the maxims by which
it may be most successfully guided and forwarded. But in
order that we may do this to the best advantage, we must
pursue still further the analysis of knowledge into its
elements; and this will be our employment in the first part
of the work.</p>

<p class="noind" id="b1c3s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> E</span>VERY
 advance in human knowledge consists, as we have
seen, in adapting new ideal conceptions to ascertained
facts, and thus in superinducing the Form upon the Matter,
the active upon the passive processes of our minds. Every
such step introduces into our knowledge an additional
portion of the ideal element, and of those relations which
flow from the nature of Ideas. It is, therefore, important
for our purpose to examine more closely this element, and to
learn what the relations are which may thus come to form
part of our knowledge. An inquiry into those Ideas which
form the foundations of our sciences;&#8212;into the reality,
independence, extent, and principal heads of the knowledge
which we thus acquire; is a task on which we must now enter,
and which will employ us for several of the succeeding
Books.</p>
<p>In this inquiry our object will be to pass in review all the
most important Fundamental Ideas which our sciences involve;
and to prove more distinctly in reference to each, what we
have already asserted with regard to all, that there are
everywhere involved in our knowledge acts of the mind as
well as impressions of sense; and that our knowledge
derives, from these acts, a generality, certainty, and
evidence which the senses could in no degree have supplied.
But before I proceed to do this in particular cases, I will
give some account of the argument in its general form.</p>
<p>We have already considered the separation of our knowledge
into its two elements,&#8212;Impressions of Sense and Ideas,&#8212;as
evidently indicated by this; that all knowledge possesses
characters which neither of these <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page58">58</a></span> elements alone could
bestow. Without our ideas, our sensations could have no
connexion; without external impressions, our ideas would
have no reality; and thus both ingredients of our knowledge
must exist.</p>
<p id="b1c3s2">2. There is another mode in which the distinction of the two
elements of knowledge appears, as I have already said (c. i.
<a href="#b1c1s2">sect. 2</a>): namely in the distinction of <i>necessary</i>, and
<i>contingent</i> or <i>experiential</i>, truths. For of
these two classes of truths, the difference arises from
this;&#8212;that the one class derives its nature from the one,
and the other from the other, of the two elements of
knowledge. I have already stated briefly the difference of
these two kinds of truths:&#8212;namely, that the former are
truths which, we see, must be true:&#8212;the latter are true,
but so far as we can see, might be otherwise. The former are
true necessarily and universally: the latter are learnt from
experience and limited by experience. Now with regard to the
former kind of truths, I wish to show that the universality
and necessity which distinguish them can by no means be
derived from experience; that these characters do in reality
flow from the ideas which these truths involve; and that
when the necessity of the truth is exhibited in the way of
logical demonstration, it is found to depend upon certain
fundamental principles, (Definitions and Axioms,) which may
thus be considered as expressing, in some measure, the
essential characters of our ideas. These fundamental
principles I shall afterwards proceed to discuss and to
exhibit in each of the principal departments of science.</p>
<p>I shall begin by considering Necessary Truths more fully
than I have yet done. As I have already said, necessary
truths are those in which we not only learn, that the
proposition <em>is</em> true, but see that it <em>must
be</em> true; in which the negation of the truth is not only
false, but impossible; in which we cannot, even by an effort
of imagination, or in a supposition, conceive the reverse of
that which is asserted.</p>
<p id="b1c3s3">3. That there are such truths cannot be doubted. We may
take, for example, all relations of number. Three and Two
added together make Five. We cannot <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page59">59</a></span> conceive it to be
otherwise. We cannot, by any freak of thought, imagine Three
and Two to make Seven.</p>
<p>It may be said that this assertion merely expresses what we
mean by our words; that it is a matter of definition; that
the proposition is an identical one.</p>
<p>But this is by no means so. The definition of Five is not
Three and Two, but Four and One. How does it appear that
Three and Two is the same number as Four and One? It is
evident that it is so; but <em>why</em> is it evident?&#8212;not
because the proposition is identical; for if that were the
reason, all numerical propositions must be evident for the
same reason. If it be a matter of definition that 3 and 2
make 5, it must be a matter of definition that 39 and 27
make 66. But who will say that the definition of 66 is 39
and 27? Yet the magnitude of the numbers can make no
difference in the ground of the truth. How do we know that
the product of 13 and 17 is 4 less than the product of 15
and 15? We see that it is so, if we perform certain
operations by the rules of arithmetic; but how do we know
the truth of the rules of arithmetic? If we divide 123375 by
987 according to the process taught us at school, how are we
assured that the result is correct, and that the number 125
thus obtained is really the number of times one number is
contained in the other?</p>
<p>The correctness of the rule, it may be replied, can be
rigorously demonstrated. It can be shown that the process
must inevitably give the true quotient.</p>
<p>Certainly this can be shown to be the case. And precisely
because it <em>can</em> be shown that the result must be true, we
have here an example of a necessary truth; and this truth,
it appears, is not <em>therefore</em> necessary because it
is itself evidently identical, however it may be possible to
prove it by reducing it to evidently identical propositions.
And the same is the case with all other numerical
propositions; for, as we have said, the nature of all of
them is the same.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have instances of truths which are not only
true, but demonstrably and necessarily true. Now such truths
are, in this respect at least, altogether <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page60">60</a></span> different
from truths, which, however certain they may be, are learnt
to be so only by the evidence of observation, interpreted,
as observation must be interpreted, by our own mental
faculties. There is no difficulty in finding examples of
these merely observed truths. We find that sugar dissolves
in water, and forms a transparent fluid, but no one will say
that we can see any reason beforehand why the result
<em>must</em> be so. We find that all animals which chew the
cud have also the divided hoof; but could any one have
predicted that this would be universally the case? or
supposing the truth of the rule to be known, can any one say
that he cannot conceive the facts as occurring otherwise?
Water expands when it crystallizes, some other substances
contract in the same circumstances; but can any one know
that this will be so otherwise than by observation? We have
here propositions <em>rigorously</em> true, (we will
assume,) but can any one say they are <em>necessarily</em>
true? These, and the great mass of the doctrines established
by induction, are actual, but so far as we can see,
accidental laws; results determined by some unknown
selection, not demonstrable consequences of the essence of
things, inevitable and perceived to be inevitable. According
to the phraseology which has been frequently used by
philosophical writers, they are <i>contingent</i>, not
necessary truths.</p>
<p>It is requisite to insist upon this opposition, because no
insight can be obtained into the true nature of knowledge,
and the mode of arriving at it, by any one who does not
clearly appreciate the distinction. The separation of truths
which are learnt by observation, and truths which can be
seen to be true by a pure act of thought, is one of the
first and most essential steps in our examination of the
nature of truth, and the mode of its discovery. If any one
does not clearly comprehend this distinction of necessary
and contingent truths, he will not be able to go along with
us in our researches into the foundations of human
knowledge; nor, indeed, to pursue with success any
speculation on the subject. But, in fact, this distinction
is one that can hardly fail to be at once understood. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page61">61</a></span> is insisted upon by almost all the best modern, as well
as ancient, metaphysicians<a id="fnanchor5-1" href="#note5-1"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>, as of primary importance.
And if any person does not fully apprehend, at first, the
different kinds of truth thus pointed out, let him study, to
some extent, those sciences which have necessary truth for
their subject, as geometry, or the properties of numbers, so
as to obtain a familiar acquaintance with such truth; and he
will then hardly fail to see how different the evidence of
the propositions which occur in these sciences, is from the
evidence of the facts which are merely learnt from
experience. That the year goes through its course in 365
days, can only be known by observation of the sun or stars:
that 365 days is 52 weeks and a day, it requires no
experience, but only a little thought to perceive. That bees
build their cells in the form of hexagons, we cannot know
without looking at them; that regular hexagons may be
arranged so as to fill space, may be proved with the utmost
rigour, even if there were not in existence such a thing as
a material hexagon.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-1" href="#fnanchor5-1">5</a></span> Aristotle, Dr Whately, Dugald Stewart, &amp;c.</div>
<p id="b1c3s4">4. As I have already said, one mode in which we may express
the difference of necessary truths and truths of experience,
is, that necessary truths are those of which we cannot
distinctly conceive the contrary. We can very readily
conceive the contrary of experiential truths. We can
conceive the stars moving about the pole or across the sky
in any kind of curves with any velocities; we can conceive
the moon always appearing during the whole month as a
luminous disk, as she might do if her light were inherent
and not borrowed. But we cannot conceive one of the
parallelograms on the same base and between the same
parallels larger than the other; for we find that, if we
attempt to do this, when we separate the parallelograms into
parts, we have to conceive one triangle larger than another,
both having all their parts equal; which we cannot conceive
at all, if we conceive the triangles distinctly. We make
this impossibility more clear by conceiving <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page62">62</a></span> the
triangles to be placed so that two sides of the one coincide
with two sides of the other; and it is then seen, that in
order to conceive the triangles unequal, we must conceive
the two bases which have the same extremities both ways, to
be different lines, though both straight lines. This it is
impossible to conceive: we assent to the impossibility as an
axiom, when it is expressed by saying, that two straight
lines cannot inclose a space; and thus we cannot distinctly
conceive the contrary of the proposition just mentioned
respecting parallelograms.</p>
<p>But it is necessary, in applying this distinction, to bear
in mind the terms of it;&#8212;that we cannot <em>distinctly</em>
conceive the contrary of a necessary truth. For in a certain
loose, indistinct way, persons conceive the contrary of
necessary geometrical truths, when they erroneously conceive
false propositions to be true. Thus, Hobbes erroneously held
that he had discovered a means of geometrically ‘doubling
the cube,’ as it is called, that is, finding two mean
proportionals between two given lines; a problem which
cannot be solved by plane geometry. Hobbes not only proposed
a construction for this purpose, but obstinately maintained
that it was right, when it had been proved to be wrong. But
then, the discussion showed how indistinct the geometrical
conceptions of Hobbes were; for when his critics had proved
that one of the lines in his diagram would not meet the
other in the point which his reasoning supposed, but in
another point near to it; he maintained, in reply, that one
of these points was large enough to include the other, so
that they might be considered as the same point. Such a mode
of conceiving the opposite of a geometrical truth, forms no
exception to the assertion, that this opposite cannot be
distinctly conceived.</p>
<p>In like manner, the indistinct conceptions of children and
of rude savages do not invalidate the distinction of
necessary and experiential truths. Children and savages make
mistakes even with regard to numbers; and might easily
happen to assert that 27 and 38 are equal to 63 or 64. But
such mistakes cannot <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page63">63</a></span> make arithmetical truths cease to
be necessary truths. When any person conceives these numbers
and their addition distinctly, by resolving them into parts,
or in any other way, he sees that their sum is necessarily
65. If, on the ground of the possibility of children and
savages conceiving something different, it be held that this
is not a necessary truth, it must be held on the same
ground, that it is not a necessary truth that 7 and 4 are
equal to 11; for children and savages might be found so
unfamiliar with numbers as not to reject the assertion that
7 and 4 are 10, or even that 4 and 3 are 6, or 8. But I
suppose that no persons would on such grounds hold that
these arithmetical truths are truths known only by
experience.</p>
<p id="b1c3s5">5. I have taken examples of necessary truths from the
properties of number and space; but such truths exist no
less in other subjects, although the discipline of thought
which is requisite to perceive them distinctly, may not be
so usual among men with regard to the sciences of mechanics
and hydrostatics, as it is with regard to the sciences of
geometry and arithmetic. Yet every one may perceive that
there are such truths in mechanics. If I press the table
with my hand, the table presses my hand with an equal force:
here is a self-evident and necessary truth. In any machine,
constructed in whatever manner to increase the force which I
can exert, it is certain that what I gain in force I must
lose in the velocity which I communicate. This is not a
contingent truth, borrowed from and limited by observation;
for a man of sound mechanical views applies it with like
confidence, however novel be the construction of the
machine. When I come to speak of the ideas which are
involved in our mechanical knowledge, I may, perhaps, be
able to bring more clearly into view the necessary truth of
general propositions on such subjects. That reaction is
equal and opposite to action, is as necessarily true as that
two straight lines cannot inclose a space; it is as
impossible theoretically to make a perpetual motion by mere
mechanism as to make the diagonal of a square commensurable
with the side. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page64">64</a></span></p>
<p id="b1c3s6">6. Necessary truths must be <em>universal</em> truths. If
any property belong to a right-angled triangle
<em>necessarily</em>, it must belong to <em>all</em>
right-angled triangles. And it shall be proved in the
following Chapter, that truths possessing these two
characters, of Necessity and Universality, cannot possibly
be the mere results of experience.</p>
<p>[Necessary truths are not considered as a portion of the
<em>Inductive</em> Sciences. They are Deductions from our
Ideas. Thus the necessary truths which constitute the
Science of Geometry are Deductions from our Idea of Space:
the necessary truths which constitute the Science of
Arithmetic are Deductions from our notions of Number; which
perhaps involves necessarily the Idea of Time. But though we
do not call those Sciences <i>Inductive</i> which involve
properties of Space, Number and Time alone, the properties
of Space, Time and Number enter in many very important ways
into the Inductive Sciences; and therefore the Ideas of
Space, Time and Number require to be considered in the first
place. And moreover the examination of these Ideas is an
essential step towards the examination of other Ideas: and
the conditions of the possibility and certainty of truth,
which are exemplified in Geometry and Arithmetic, open to us
important views respecting the conditions of the possibility
and certainty of all Scientific Truth. We shall therefore in
the next <a href="#v1page85">Book</a> examine the Ideas on which the Pure Sciences,
Geometry and Arithmetic, are founded. But we must first say
a little more of Ideas in general.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of Experience.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b1c4s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>
HERE employ the term Experience in a more definite and
limited sense than that which it possesses in common usage;
for I restrict it to matters belonging to the domain of
science. In such cases, the knowledge which we acquire, by
means of experience, is of a clear and precise nature; and
the passions and feelings and interests, which make the
lessons of experience in practical matters so difficult to
read aright, no longer disturb and confuse us. We may,
therefore, hope, by attending to such cases, to learn what
efficacy experience really has, in the discovery of truth.</p>
<p>That from <em>experience</em> (including intentional
experience, or <i>observation</i>,) we obtain much knowledge
which is highly important, and which could not be procured
from any other source, is abundantly clear. We have already
taken several examples of such knowledge. We know by
experience that animals which ruminate are cloven-hoofed;
and we know this in no other manner. We know, in like
manner, that all the planets and their satellites revolve
round the sun from west to east. It has been found by
experience that all meteoric stones contain chrome. Many
similar portions of our knowledge might be mentioned.</p>
<p>Now what we have here to remark is this;&#8212;that in no case
can experience prove a proposition to be
<em>necessarily</em> or <em>universally</em> true. However
many instances we may have observed of the truth of a
proposition, yet if it be known merely by observation, there
is nothing to assure us that the next case shall not be an
exception to the rule. If it be strictly true that every
ruminant animal yet known has cloven hoofs, we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page66">66</a></span> still
cannot be sure that some creature will not hereafter be
discovered which has the first of these attributes without
having the other. When the planets and their satellites, as
far as Saturn, had been all found to move round the sun in
one direction, it was still possible that there might be
other such bodies not obeying this rule; and, accordingly,
when the satellites of Uranus were detected, they appeared
to offer an exception of this kind. Even in the mathematical
sciences, we have examples of such rules suggested by
experience, and also of their precariousness. However far
they may have been tested, we cannot depend upon their
correctness, except we see some reason for the rule. For
instance, various rules have been given, for the purpose of
pointing out <i>prime numbers</i>; that is, those which
cannot be divided by any other number. We may try, as an
example of such a rule, this one&#8212;any odd power of the
number two, diminished by one. Thus the third power of two,
diminished by one, is seven; the fifth power, diminished by
one, is thirty-one; the seventh power so diminished is one
hundred and twenty-seven. All these are prime numbers: and
we might be led to suppose that the rule is universal. But
the next example shows us the fallaciousness of such a
belief. The ninth power of two, diminished by one, is five
hundred and eleven, which is not a prime, being divisible by
seven.</p>
<p>Experience must always consist of a limited number of
observations. And, however numerous these may be, they can
show nothing with regard to the infinite number of cases in
which the experiment has not been made. Experience being
thus unable to prove a fact to be universal, is, as will
readily be seen, still more incapable of proving a truth to
be necessary. Experience cannot, indeed, offer the smallest
ground for the necessity of a proposition. She can observe
and record what has happened; but she cannot find, in any
case, or in any accumulation of cases, any reason for what
must happen. She may see objects side by side; but she
cannot see a reason why they must ever be side by side. She
finds certain events to occur in succession; but the
succession supplies, in its occurrence, no <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page67">67</a></span> reason for
its recurrence. She contemplates external objects; but she
cannot detect any internal bond, which indissolubly connects
the future with the past, the possible with the real. To
learn a proposition by experience, and to see it to be
necessarily true, are two altogether different processes of
thought.</p>
<p id="b1c4s2">2. But it may be said, that we do learn by means of
observation and experience many universal truths; indeed,
all the general truths of which science consists. Is not the
doctrine of universal gravitation learnt by experience? Are
not the laws of motion, the properties of light, the general
principles of chemistry, so learnt? How, with these examples
before us, can we say that experience teaches no universal
truths?</p>
<p>To this we reply, that these truths can only be known to be
general, not universal, if they depend upon experience
alone. Experience cannot bestow that universality which she
herself cannot have, and that necessity of which she has no
comprehension. If these doctrines <em>are</em> universally true, this
universality flows from the <em>ideas</em> which we apply to
our experience, and which are, as we have seen, the real
sources of necessary truth. How far these ideas can
communicate their universality and necessity to the results
of experience, it will hereafter be our business to
consider. It will then appear, that when the mind collects
from observation truths of a wide and comprehensive kind,
which approach to the simplicity and universality of the
truths of pure science; she gives them this character by
throwing upon them the light of her own Fundamental Ideas.</p>
<p>But the truths which we discover by observation of the
external world, even when most strikingly simple and
universal, are not necessary truths. Is the doctrine of
universal gravitation necessarily true? It was doubted by
Clairaut (so far as it refers to the moon), when the
progression of the apogee in fact appeared to be twice as
great as the theory admitted. It has been doubted, even more
recently, with respect to the planets, their mutual
perturbations appearing to indicate a deviation from the
law. It is doubted still, by some <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page68">68</a></span> persons, with respect
to the double stars. But suppose all these doubts to be
banished, and the law to be universal; is it then proved to
be necessary? Manifestly not: the very existence of these
doubts proves that it is not so. For the doubts were
dissipated by reference to observation and calculation, not
by reasoning on the nature of the law. Clairaut’s difficulty
was removed by a more exact calculation of the effect of the
sun’s force on the motion of the apogee. The suggestion of
Bessel, that the intensity of gravitation might be different
for different planets, was found to be unnecessary, when
Professor Airy gave a more accurate determination of the
mass of Jupiter. And the question whether the extension of
the law of the inverse square to the double stars be true,
(one of the most remarkable questions now before the
scientific world,) must be answered, not by any speculations
concerning what the laws of attraction must necessarily be,
but by carefully determining the actual laws of the motion
of these curious objects, by means of the observations such
as those which Sir John Herschel has collected for that
purpose, by his unexampled survey of both hemispheres of the
sky. And since the extent of this truth is thus to be
determined by reference to observed facts, it is clear that
no mere accumulation of them can make its universality
certain, or its necessity apparent.</p>
<p>Thus no knowledge of the necessity of any truths can result
from the observation of what really happens. This being
clearly understood, we are led to an important inquiry.</p>
<p>The characters of universality and necessity in the truths
which form part of our knowledge, can never be derived from
experience, by which so large a part of our knowledge is
obtained. But since, as we have seen, we really do possess a
large body of truths which are necessary, and because
necessary, therefore universal, the question still recurs,
from what source these characters of universality and
necessity are derived.</p>
<p>The answer to this question we will attempt to give in the
next chapter.</p>
<div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Grounds of Necessary Truths.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b1c5s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>O
the question just stated, I reply, that the necessity
and universality of the truths which form a part of our
knowledge, are derived from the <em>Fundamental Ideas</em>
which those truths involve. These ideas entirely shape and
circumscribe our knowledge; they regulate the active
operations of our minds, without which our passive
sensations do not become knowledge. They govern these
operations, according to rules which are not only fixed and
permanent, but which may be expressed in plain and definite
terms; and these rules, when thus expressed, may be made the
basis of demonstrations by which the necessary relations
imparted to our knowledge by our Ideas may be traced to
their consequences in the most remote ramifications of
scientific truth.</p>
<p>These enunciations of the necessary and evident conditions
imposed upon our knowledge by the Fundamental Ideas which it
involves, are termed <i>Axioms</i>. Thus the Axioms of
Geometry express the necessary conditions which result from
the Idea of Space; the Axioms of Mechanics express the
necessary conditions which flow from the Ideas of Force and
Motion; and so on.</p>
<p id="b1c5s2">2. It will be the office of several of the succeeding Books
of this work to establish and illustrate in detail what I
have thus stated in general terms. I shall there pass in
review many of the most important fundamental ideas on which
the existing body of our science depends; and I shall
endeavour to show, for each such idea in succession, that
knowledge involves an active as well as a passive element;
that it is not possible without an act of the mind,
regulated by certain <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page70">70</a></span> laws. I shall further attempt to
enumerate some of the principal fundamental relations which
each idea thus introduces into our thoughts, and to express
them by means of definitions and axioms, and other suitable
forms.</p>
<p>I will only add a remark or two to illustrate further this
view of the ideal grounds of our knowledge.</p>
<p id="b1c5s3">3. To persons familiar with any of the demonstrative
sciences, it will be apparent that if we state all the
Definitions and Axioms which are employed in the
demonstrations, we state the whole basis on which those
reasonings rest. For the whole process of demonstrative or
deductive reasoning in any science, (as in geometry, for
instance,) consists entirely in combining some of these
first principles so as to obtain the simplest propositions
of the science; then combining these so as to obtain other
propositions of greater complexity; and so on, till we
advance to the most recondite demonstrable truths; these
last, however intricate and unexpected, still involving no
principles except the original definitions and axioms. Thus,
by combining the Definition of a triangle, and the
Definitions of equal lines and equal angles, namely, that
they are such as when applied to each other, coincide, with
the Axiom respecting straight lines (that two such lines
cannot inclose a space,) we demonstrate the equality of
triangles, under certain assumed conditions. Again, by
combining this result with the Definition of parallelograms,
and with the Axiom that if equals be taken from equals the
wholes are equal, we prove the equality of parallelograms
between the same parallels and upon the same base. From this
proposition, again, we prove the equality of the square on
the hypotenuse of a triangle to the squares on the two sides
containing the right angle. But in all this there is nothing
contained which is not rigorously the result of our
geometrical Definitions and Axioms. All the rest of our
treatises of geometry consists only of terms and phrases of
reasoning, the object of which is to connect those first
principles, and to exhibit the effects of their combination
in the shape of demonstration. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page71">71</a></span></p>
<p id="b1c5s4">4. This combination of first principles takes place
according to the forms and rules of <em>Logic</em>. All the
steps of the demonstration may be stated in the shape in
which logicians are accustomed to exhibit processes of
reasoning in order to show their conclusiveness, that is, in
<i>Syllogisms</i>. Thus our geometrical reasonings might be
resolved into such steps as the following:&#8212;<br/>
&#8195;All straight lines drawn from the centre of a circle to its
circumference are equal:<br/>
&#8195;But the straight lines <span class="sc">ab, ac</span>, are drawn from the centre of
a circle to its circumference:<br/>
&#8195;Therefore the straight lines <span class="sc">ab, ac</span>, are equal.</p>
<p>Each step of geometrical, and all other demonstrative
reasoning, may be resolved into three such clauses as these;
and these three clauses are termed respectively, the
<i>major premiss</i>, the <i>minor premiss</i>, and the
<i>conclusion</i>; or, more briefly, the <i>major</i>, the
<i>minor</i>, and the <span class="correction" title="emended from conlcusion"><i>conclusion</i></span>.</p>
<p>The principle which justifies the reasoning when exhibited
in this syllogistic form, is this:&#8212;that a truth which can
be asserted as generally, or rather as universally true, can
be asserted as true also in each particular case. The
<i>minor</i> only asserts a certain particular case to be an
example of such conditions as are spoken of in the
<i>major</i>; and hence the conclusion, which is true of the
major by supposition, is true of the minor by consequence;
and thus we proceed from syllogism to syllogism, in each one
employing some general truth in some particular instance.
Any proof which occurs in geometry, or any other science of
demonstration, may thus be reduced to a series of processes,
in each of which we pass from some general proposition to
the narrower and more special propositions which it
includes. And this process of deriving truths by the mere
combination of general principles, applied in particular
hypothetical cases, is called <i>deduction</i>; being
opposed to <i>induction</i>, in which, as we have seen
(chap. i. <a href="#b1c1s3">sect. 3</a>), a new general principle is introduced at
every step.</p>
<p id="b1c5s5">5. Now we have to remark that, this being so, however far we
follow such deductive reasoning, we can <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page72">72</a></span> never have, in
our conclusion any truth which is not virtually included in
the original principles from which the reasoning started.
For since at any step we merely take out of a general
proposition something included in it, while at the preceding
step we have taken this general proposition out of one more
general, and so on perpetually, it is manifest that our last
result was really included in the principle or principles
with which we began. I say <i>principles</i>, because,
although our logical conclusion can only exhibit the
legitimate issue of our first principles, it may,
nevertheless, contain the result of the combination of
several such principles, and may thus assume a great degree
of complexity, and may appear so far removed from the parent
truths, as to betray at first sight hardly any relationship
with them. Thus the proposition which has already been
quoted respecting the squares on the sides of a right-angled
triangle, contains the results of many elementary
principles; as, the definitions of parallels, triangle, and
square; the axioms respecting straight lines, and respecting
parallels; and, perhaps, others. The conclusion is
complicated by containing the effects of the combination of
all these elements; but it contains nothing, and can contain
nothing, but such elements and their combinations.</p>
<p>This doctrine, that logical reasoning produces no new
truths, but only unfolds and brings into view those truths
which were, in effect, contained in the first principles of
the reasoning, is assented to by almost all who, in modern
times, have attended to the science of logic. Such a view is
admitted both by those who defend, and by those who
depreciate the value of logic. ‘Whatever is established by
reasoning, must have been contained and virtually asserted
in the premises<a id="fnanchor6-1" href="#note6-1"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>.’ ‘The only truth which such
propositions can possess consists in conformity to the
original principles.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-1" href="#fnanchor6-1">6</a></span> Whately’s <i>Logic</i>, pp. 237, 238.</div>
<p>In this manner the whole substance of our geometry is
reduced to the Definitions and Axioms which we employ in our
elementary reasonings; and in like <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page73">73</a></span> manner we reduce the
demonstrative truths of any other science to the definitions
and axioms which we there employ.</p>
<p id="b1c5s6">6. But in reference to this subject, it has sometimes been
said that demonstrative sciences do in reality depend upon
Definitions only; and that no additional kind of principle,
such as we have supposed Axioms to be, is absolutely
required. It has been asserted that in geometry, for
example, the source of the necessary truth of our
propositions is this, that they depend upon definitions
alone, and consequently merely state the identity of the
same thing under different aspects.</p>
<p>That in the sciences which admit of demonstration, as
geometry, mechanics, and the like, Axioms as well as
Definitions are needed, in order to express the grounds of
our necessary convictions, must be shown hereafter by an
examination of each of these sciences in particular. But
that the propositions of these sciences, those of geometry
for example, do not merely assert the identity of the same
thing, will, I think, be generally allowed, if we consider
the assertions which we are enabled to make. When we declare
that ‘a straight line is the shortest distance between two
points,’ is this merely an identical proposition? the
definition of a straight line in another form? Not so: the
definition of a straight line involves the notion of form
only, and does not contain anything about magnitude;
consequently, it cannot contain anything equivalent to
‘shortest.’ Thus the propositions of geometry are not merely
identical propositions; nor have we in their general
character anything to countenance the assertion, that they
are the results of definitions alone. And when we come to
examine this and other sciences more closely, we shall find
that axioms, such as are usually in our treatises made the
fundamental principles of our demonstrations, neither have
ever been, nor can be, dispensed with. Axioms, as well as
Definitions, are in all cases requisite, in order properly
to exhibit the grounds of necessary truth.</p>
<p id="b1c5s7">7. Thus the real logical basis of every body of demonstrated
truths are the Definitions and Axioms <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page74">74</a></span> which are the
first principles of the reasonings. But when we are arrived
at this point, the question further occurs, what is the
ground of the truth of these Axioms? It is not the logical,
but the philosophical, not the formal, but the real
foundation of necessary truth, which we are seeking. Hence
this inquiry necessarily comes before us, What is the ground
of the Axioms of Geometry, of Mechanics, and of any other
demonstrable science?</p>
<p>The answer which we are led to give, by the view which we
have taken of the nature of knowledge, has already been
stated. The ground of the axioms belonging to each science
is the <em>Idea</em> which the axiom involves. The ground of
the Axioms of Geometry is the <i>Idea of Space</i>: the
ground of the Axioms of Mechanics is the <i>Idea of
Force</i>, of <i>Action</i> and <i>Reaction</i>, and the
like. And hence these Ideas are Fundamental Ideas; and since
they are thus the foundations, not only of demonstration but
of truth, an examination into their real import and nature
is of the greatest consequence to our purpose.</p>
<p id="b1c5s8">8. Not only the Axioms, but the definitions which form the
basis of our reasonings, depend upon our Fundamental Ideas.
And the Definitions are not arbitrary definitions, but are
determined by a necessity no less rigorous than the Axioms
themselves. We could not think of geometrical truths without
conceiving a circle; and we could not reason concerning such
truths without defining a circle in some mode equivalent to
that which is commonly adopted. The Definitions of
parallels, of right angles, and the like, are quite as
necessarily prescribed by the nature of the case, as the
Axioms which these Definitions bring with them. Indeed we
may substitute one of these kinds of principles for another.
We cannot always put a Definition in the place of an Axiom;
but we may always find an Axiom which shall take the place
of a Definition. If we assume a proper Axiom respecting
straight lines, we need no Definition of a straight line.
But in whatever shape the principle appear, as Definition or
as Axiom, it has about it nothing casual or <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page75">75</a></span> arbitrary,
but is determined to be what it is, as to its import, by the
most rigorous necessity, growing out of the Idea of Space.</p>
<p id="b1c5s9">9. These principles,&#8212;Definitions, and Axioms,&#8212;thus
exhibiting the primary developments of a fundamental idea,
do in fact express the idea, so far as its expression in
words forms part of our science. They are different views of
the same body of truth; and though each principle, by
itself, exhibits only one aspect of this body, taken
together they convey a sufficient conception of it for our
purposes. The Idea itself cannot be fixed in words; but
these various lines of truth proceeding from it, suggest
sufficiently to a fitly-prepared mind, the place where the
idea resides, its nature, and its efficacy.</p>
<p>It is true that these principles,&#8212;our elementary
Definitions and Axioms,&#8212;even taken all together, express
the Idea incompletely. Thus the Definitions and Axioms of
Geometry, as they are stated in our elementary works, do not
fully express the Idea of Space as it exists in our minds.
For, in addition to these, other Axioms, independent of
these, and no less evident, can be stated; and are in fact
stated when we come to the Higher Geometry. Such, for
instance, is the Axiom of Archimedes&#8212;that a curve line
which joins two points is less than a broken line which
joins the same points and includes the curve. And thus the
Idea is disclosed but not fully revealed, imparted but not
transfused, by the use we make of it in science. When we
have taken from the fountain so much as serves our purpose,
there still remains behind a deep well of truth, which we
have not exhausted, and which we may easily believe to be
inexhaustible.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">The Fundamental Ideas are not Derived from Experience.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b1c6s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> B</span>Y
the course of speculation contained in the last three
Chapters, we are again led to the conclusion which we have
already stated, that our knowledge contains an ideal
element, and that this element is not derived from
experience. For we have seen that there are propositions
which are known to be necessarily true; and that such
knowledge is not, and cannot be, obtained by mere
observation of actual facts. It has been shown, also, that
these necessary truths are the results of certain
fundamental ideas, such as those of space, number, and the
like. Hence it follows inevitably that these ideas and
others of the same kind are not derived from experience. For
these ideas possess a power of infusing into their
developments that very necessity which experience can in no
way bestow. This power they do not borrow from the external
world, but possess by their own nature. Thus we unfold out
of the Idea of Space the propositions of geometry, which are
plainly truths of the most rigorous necessity and
universality. But if the idea of space were merely collected
from observation of the external world, it could never
enable or entitle us to assert such propositions: it could
never authorize us to say that not merely some lines, but
<em>all</em> lines, not only have, but <em>must</em> have,
those properties which geometry teaches. Geometry in every
proposition speaks a language which experience never dares
to utter; and indeed of which she but half comprehends the
meaning. Experience sees that the assertions are true, but
she sees not how profound and absolute is their truth. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page77">77</a></span>
She unhesitatingly assents to the laws which geometry
delivers, but she does not pretend to see the origin of
their obligation. She is always ready to acknowledge the
sway of pure scientific principles as a matter of fact, but
she does not dream of offering her opinion on their
authority as a matter of right; still less can she justly
claim to be herself the source of that authority.</p>
<p>David Hume asserted<a id="fnanchor7-1" href="#note7-1"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>, that we are incapable of seeing in
any of the appearances which the world presents anything of
necessary connexion; and hence he inferred that our
knowledge cannot extend to any such connexion. It will be
seen from what we have said that we assent to his remark as
to the fact, but we differ from him altogether in the
consequence to be drawn from it. Our inference from Hume’s
observation is, not the truth of his conclusion, but the
falsehood of his premises;&#8212;not that, therefore, we can know
nothing of natural connexion, but that, therefore, we have
some other source of knowledge than experience:&#8212;not, that
we can have no idea of connexion or causation, because, in
his language, it cannot be the copy of an impression; but
that since we have such an idea, our ideas are not the
copies of our impressions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-1" href="#fnanchor7-1">7</a></span> <i>Essays</i>, vol. ii. p. 70.</div>
<p>Since it thus appears that our fundamental ideas are not
acquired from the external world by our senses, but have
some separate and independent origin, it is important for us
to examine their nature and properties, as they exist in
themselves; and this it will be our business to do through a
portion of the following pages. But it may be proper first
to notice one or two objections which may possibly occur to
some readers.</p>
<p id="b1c6s2">2. It may be said that without the use of our senses, of
sight and touch, for instance, we should never have any idea
of space; that this idea, therefore, may properly be said to
be derived from those senses. And to this I reply, by
referring to a parallel instance. Without light we should
have no perception of visible <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page78">78</a></span> figure; yet the power of
perceiving visible figure cannot be said to be derived from
the light, but resides in the structure of the eye. If we
had never seen objects in the light, we should be quite
unaware that we possessed a power of vision; yet we should
not possess it the less on that account. If we had never
exercised the senses of sight and touch (if we can conceive
such a state of human existence) we know not that we should
be conscious of an idea of space. But the light reveals to
us at the same time the existence of external objects and
our own power of seeing. And in a very similar manner, the
exercise of our senses discloses to us, at the same time,
the external world, and our own ideas of space, time, and
other conditions, without which the external world can
neither be observed nor conceived. That light is necessary
to vision, does not, in any degree, supersede the importance
of a separate examination of the laws of our visual powers,
if we would understand the nature of our own bodily
faculties and the extent of the information they can give
us. In like manner, the fact that intercourse with the
external world is necessary for the conscious employment of
our ideas, does not make it the less essential for us to
examine those ideas in their most intimate structure, in
order that we may understand the grounds and limits of our
knowledge. Even before we see a single object, we have a
faculty of vision; and in like manner, if we can suppose a
man who has never contemplated an object in space or time,
we must still assume him to have the faculties of
entertaining the ideas of space and time, which faculties
are called into play on the very first occasion of the use
of the senses.</p>
<p id="b1c6s3">3. In answer to such remarks as the above, it has sometimes
been said that to assume separate faculties in the mind for
so many different processes of thought, is to give a mere
verbal explanation, since we learn nothing concerning our
idea of space by being told that we have a faculty of
forming such an idea. It has been said that this course of
explanation leads to an endless multiplication of elements
in man’s nature, without any advantage to our knowledge of
his true <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page79">79</a></span> constitution. We may, it is said, assert man
to have a faculty of walking, of standing, of breathing, of
speaking; but what, it is asked, is gained by such
assertions? To this I reply, that we undoubtedly have such
faculties as those just named; that it is by no means
unimportant to consider them; and that the main question in
such cases is, whether they are separate and independent
faculties, or complex and derivative ones; and, if the
latter be the case, what are the simple and original
faculties by the combination of which the others are
produced. In walking, standing, breathing, for instance, a
great part of the operation can be reduced to one single
faculty; the voluntary exercise of our muscles. But in
breathing this does not appear to be the whole of the
process. The operation is, in part at least, involuntary;
and it has been held that there is a certain sympathetic
action of the nerves, in addition to the voluntary agency
which they transmit, which is essential to the function. To
determine whether or no this sympathetic faculty is real and
distinct, and if so, what are its laws and limits, is
certainly a highly philosophical inquiry, and well deserving
the attention which has been bestowed upon it by eminent
physiologists. And just of the same nature are the inquiries
with respect to man’s intellectual constitution, on which we
propose to enter. For instance, man has a faculty of
apprehending time, and a faculty of reckoning numbers: are
these distinct, or is one faculty derived from the other? To
analyze the various combinations of our ideas and
observations into the original faculties which they involve;
to show that these faculties are original, and not capable
of further analysis: to point out the characters which mark
these faculties and lead to the most important features of
our knowledge;&#8212;these are the kind of researches on which we
have now to enter, and these, we trust, will be found to be
far from idle or useless parts of our plan. If we succeed in
such attempts, it will appear that it is by no means a
frivolous or superfluous step to distinguish separate
faculties in the mind. If we do not learn much by being told
that we have a faculty <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page80">80</a></span> of forming the idea of space, we
at least, by such a commencement, circumscribe a certain
portion of the field of our investigations, which, we shall
afterwards endeavour to show, requires and rewards a special
examination. And though we shall thus have to separate the
domain of our philosophy into many provinces, these are, as
we trust it will appear, neither arbitrarily assigned, nor
vague in their limits, nor infinite in number.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Philosophy of the Sciences.</span></h3>

<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span>
proceed, in the ensuing Books, to the closer examination
of a considerable number of those Fundamental Ideas on which
the sciences, hitherto most successfully cultivated, are
founded. In this task, our objects will be to explain and
analyze such Ideas so as to bring into view the Definitions
and Axioms, or other forms, in which we may clothe the
conditions to which our speculative knowledge is subjected.
I shall also try to prove, for some of these Ideas in
particular, what has been already urged respecting them in
general, that they are not derived from observation, but
necessarily impose their conditions upon that knowledge of
which observation supplies the materials. I shall further,
in some cases, endeavour to trace the history of these Ideas
as they have successively come into notice in the progress
of science; the gradual development by which they have
arrived at their due purity and clearness; and, as a
necessary part of such a history, I shall give a view of
some of the principal controversies which have taken place
with regard to each portion of knowledge.</p>
<p>An exposition and discussion of the Fundamental Ideas of
each Science may, with great propriety, be termed the
<span class="sc">Philosophy of</span> such <span class="sc">Science</span>. These ideas contain in
themselves the elements of those truths which the science
discovers and enunciates; and in the progress of the
sciences, both in the world at large and in the mind of each
individual student, the most important steps consist in
apprehending these ideas clearly, and in bringing them into
accordance with the observed facts. I shall, therefore, in a
series of Books, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page82">82</a></span> treat of the <i>Philosophy of the Pure
Sciences</i>, the <i>Philosophy of the Mechanical
Sciences</i>, the <i>Philosophy of Chemistry</i>, and the
like, and shall analyze and examine the ideas which these
sciences respectively involve.</p>
<p>In this undertaking, inevitably somewhat long, and involving
many deep and subtle discussions, I shall take, as a chart
of the country before me, by which my course is to be
guided, the scheme of the sciences which I was led to form
by travelling over the history of each in order<a id="fnanchor8-1" href="#note8-1"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>. Each
of the sciences of which I then narrated the progress,
depends upon several of the Fundamental Ideas of which I
have to speak: some of these Ideas are peculiar to one field

enumeration of Ideas thus collected may serve both to show
the course and limits of this part of our plan, and the

<p>I shall, then, successively, have to speak Of the Ideas
which are the foundation of Geometry and Arithmetic, (and
which also regulate all sciences depending upon these, as
Astronomy and Mechanics;) namely, the Ideas of <i>Space</i>,
<i>Time</i>, and <i>Number</i> (<a href="#v1page85">Book <span class="sc">ii</span></a>.):<br/>
&#8195;Of the Ideas on which the Mechanical Sciences (as Mechanics,
Hydrostatics, Physical Astronomy) more peculiarly rest; the
ideas of <i>Force</i> and <i>Matter</i>, or rather the idea
of <i>Cause</i>, which is the basis of these (<a href="#v1page169">Book <span class="sc">iii</span></a>.):<br/>
&#8195;Of the Ideas which the Secondary Mechanical Sciences
(Acoustics, Optics, and Thermotics) involve; namely, the
Ideas of the <i>Externality</i> of objects, and of the
<i>Media</i> by which we perceive their qualities (<a href="#v1page291">Book <span class="sc">iv</span></a>.):<br/>
&#8195;Of the Ideas which are the basis of Mechanico-chemical and
Chemical Science; <i>Polarity</i>, <i>Chemical Affinity</i>,
and <i>Substance</i>; and the Idea of <i>Symmetry</i>, a
necessary part of the Philosophy of Crystallography (Books
<span class="sc"><a href="#v1page357">v.</a> <a href="#v2page1">vi</a></span>.):<br/>
&#8195;Of the Ideas on which the Classificatory Sciences proceed
(Mineralogy, Botany, and Zoology); namely, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page83">83</a></span> the Ideas of
<i>Resemblance</i>, and of its gradations, and of <i>Natural
Affinity</i> (Books <span class="sc"><a href="#v2page65">vii.</a> <a href="#v2page93">viii.</a></span>):<br/>
&#8195;Finally, of those Ideas on which the Physiological Sciences
are founded; the Ideas of separate Vital Powers, such as
<i>Assimilation</i> and <i>Irritability</i>; and the Idea of
<i>Final Cause</i> (<a href="#v2page167">Book <span class="sc">ix</span></a>.):<br/>
&#8195;We have, besides these, the Palætiological Sciences, which
proceed mainly on the conception of <i>Historical
Causation</i> (<a href="#v2page255">Book <span class="sc">x</span></a>.):</p>
<p>It is plain that when we have proceeded so far as this, we
have advanced to the verge of those speculations which have
to do with mind as well as body. The extension of our
philosophy to such a field, if it can be justly so extended,
will be one of the most important results of our researches;
but on that very account we must fully study the lessons
which we learn in those fields of speculation where our
doctrines are most secure, before we venture into a region
where our principles will appear to be more precarious, and
where they are inevitably less precise.</p>
<p>We now proceed to the examination of the above Ideas, and to
such essays towards the philosophy of each Science as this
course of investigation may suggest.</p>

<p class="blkquot">The way in which we are led to regard human knowledge is
like the way in which Copernicus was led to regard the
heavens. When the explanation of the celestial motions could
not be made to go right so long as he assumed that all the
host of stars turns round the spectator, he tried whether it
would not answer better if he made the spectator turn, and
left the stars at rest. We may make a similar trial in
Metaphysics, as to our way of looking at objects. If our
view of them must be governed altogether by the properties
of the objects themselves, I see not how man can know
anything about them <i>à priori</i>. But if the thing, as an
object of the senses, is regulated by the constitution of
our power of knowing, I can very readily represent to myself
this possibility.</p>

<p class="center">THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PURE SCIENCES.</p>
<hr class="three" />
<p>[The principal question discussed in the last Book was this
(see chaps. <a href="#v1page69"><span class="sc">v</span>.</a> and <a href="#v1page76"><span class="sc">vi</span>.</a>): How are <em>necessary</em> and
<em>universal</em> truths possible? And the answer then
given was: that the necessity and universality of truths are
derived from the <em>Fundamental Ideas</em> which they
involve. And we proceed in this Book to exemplify this
doctrine in the case of the truths of Geometry and
Arithmetic, which derive their necessity and universality
from the Fundamental Ideas of Space, and Time, or Number.</p>
<p>The question thus examined is that which Kant undertook to
deal with in his celebrated work, <i>Kritik der reinen
Vernunft</i> (<i>Examination of the Pure Reason</i>): and
our solution of the Problem, so far as the Ideas of Space
and Time are concerned, agrees in the main with his. The
arguments contained in chapters <a href="#v1page91"><span class="sc">ii</span>.</a> and <a href="#v1page131"><span class="correction" title="emended from VI"><span class="sc">vii</span></span>.</a> of this Book,
are the leading arguments respecting Space and Time, in
Kant’s <i>Kritik</i>. Kant, however, instead of calling
Space and Time <i>Ideas</i>, calls them the necessary
<i>Forms</i> of our experience, as I have stated in the
text.</p>
<p>But though I have adopted Kant’s arguments as to Space and
Time, all that follows in the succeeding Books, with regard
to other Ideas, has no resemblance to any doctrines of Kant
or his school (with the exception, perhaps, of some of the
views on the Idea of <i>Cause</i>). The nature and character
of the other Scientific Ideas which I have examined, in the
succeeding Books, have been established by an analysis of
the history of the several Sciences to which those Ideas are
essential, and an examination of the writings of the
principal discoverers in those Sciences.]</p>

external objects and events which we can contemplate
are viewed as having relations of Space, Time, and Number;
and are subject to the general conditions which these Ideas
impose, as well as to the particular laws which belong to
each class of objects and occurrences. The special laws of
nature, considered under the various aspects which
constitute the different sciences, are obtained by a mixed
reference to Experience and to the Fundamental Ideas of each
science. But besides the sciences thus formed by the aid of
special experience, the conditions which flow from those
more comprehensive ideas first mentioned, Space, Time, and
Number, constitute a body of science, applicable to objects
and changes of all kinds, and deduced without recurrence
being had to any observation in particular. These sciences,
thus unfolded out of ideas alone, unmixed with any reference
to the phenomena of matter, are hence termed <i>Pure</i>
Sciences. The principal sciences of this class are Geometry,
Theoretical Arithmetic, and Algebra considered in its most
general sense, as the investigation of the relations of
space and number by means of general symbols.</p>
<p id="b2c1s2">2. These Pure Sciences were not included in our survey of
the history of the sciences, because they are not
<em>inductive</em> sciences. Their progress has not
consisted in collecting laws from phenomena, true theories
from observed facts, and more general from more limited
laws; but in tracing the consequences of the ideas
themselves, and in detecting the most general and intimate
analogies and connexions which prevail <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page89">89</a></span> among such
conceptions as are derivable from the ideas. These sciences
have no principles besides definitions and axioms, and no
process of proof but <em>deduction</em>; this process, however,
assuming here a most remarkable character; and exhibiting a
combination of simplicity and complexity, of rigour and
generality, quite unparalleled in other subjects.</p>
<p id="b2c1s3">3. The universality of the truths, and the rigour of the
demonstrations of these pure sciences, attracted attention
in the earliest times; and it was perceived that they
offered an exercise and a discipline of the intellectual
faculties, in a form peculiarly free from admixture of
extraneous elements. They were strenuously cultivated by the
Greeks, both with a view to such a discipline, and from the
love of speculative truth which prevailed among that people:
and the name <i>mathematics</i>, by which they are
designated, indicates this their character of
<i>disciplinal</i> studies.</p>
<p id="b2c1s4">4. As has already been said, the ideas which these sciences
involve extend to all the objects and changes which we
observe in the external world; and hence the consideration
of mathematical relations forms a large portion of many of
the sciences which treat of the phenomena and laws of
external nature, as Astronomy, Optics, and Mechanics. Such
sciences are hence often termed <i>Mixed Mathematics</i>,
the relations of space and number being, in these branches
of knowledge, combined with principles collected from
special observation; while Geometry, Algebra, and the like
subjects, which involve no result of experience, are called
<i>Pure Mathematics</i>.</p>
<p id="b2c1s5">5. Space, time, and number, may be conceived as
<em>forms</em> by which the knowledge derived from our
sensations is moulded, and which are independent of the
differences in the <em>matter</em> of our knowledge, arising from the
sensations themselves. Hence the sciences which have these
ideas for their subject may be termed <i>Formal
Sciences</i>. In this point of view, they are distinguished
from sciences in which, besides these mere formal laws by
which appearances are corrected, we endeavour to apply to
the phenomena the idea of cause, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page90">90</a></span> or some of the other
ideas which penetrate further into the principles of nature.
We have thus, in the History, distinguished Formal Astronomy
and Formal Optics from Physical Astronomy and Physical
Optics.</p>
<p>We now proceed to our examination of the Ideas which
constitute the foundation of these formal or pure
mathematical sciences, beginning with the Idea of Space.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Idea of Space.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b2c2s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> B</span>Y
speaking of space as an Idea, I intend to imply, as
has already been stated, that the apprehension of objects as
existing in space, and of the relations of position, &amp;c.,
prevailing among them, is not a consequence of experience,
but a result of a peculiar constitution and activity of the
mind, which is independent of all experience in its origin,
though constantly combined with experience in its exercise.</p>
<p>That the idea of space is thus independent of experience,
has already been pointed out in speaking of ideas in
general: but it may be useful to illustrate the doctrine
further in this particular case.</p>
<p>I assert, then, that space is not a notion obtained by
experience. Experience gives us information concerning
things without us: but our apprehending them <em>as</em>
without us, takes for granted their existence in space.
Experience acquaints us what are the form, position,
magnitude of particular objects: but that they have form,
position, magnitude, presupposes that they are in space. We
cannot derive from appearances, by the way of observation,
the habit of representing things to ourselves as in space;
for no single act of observation is possible any otherwise
than by beginning with such a representation, and conceiving
objects as already existing in space.</p>
<p id="b2c2s2">2. That our mode of representing space to ourselves is not
derived from experience, is clear also from this: that
through this mode of representation we arrive at
propositions which are rigorously universal and necessary.
Propositions of such a kind could not possibly be obtained
from experience; for experience can <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page92">92</a></span> only teach us by a
limited number of examples, and therefore can never securely
establish a universal proposition: and again, experience can
only inform us that anything is so, and can never prove that
it must be so. That two sides of a triangle are greater than
the third is a universal and necessary geometrical truth: it
is true of all triangles; it is true in such a way that the
contrary cannot be conceived. Experience could not prove
such a proposition. And experience has not proved it; for
perhaps no man ever made the trial as a means of removing
doubts: and no trial could, in fact, add in the smallest
degree to the certainty of this truth. To seek for proof of
geometrical propositions by an appeal to observation proves
nothing in reality, except that the person who has recourse
to such grounds has no due apprehension of the nature of
geometrical demonstration. We have heard of persons who
convinced themselves by measurement that the geometrical
rule respecting the squares on the sides of a right-angled
triangle was true: but these were persons whose minds had
been engrossed by practical habits, and in whom the
speculative development of the idea of space had been
stifled by other employments. The practical trial of the
rule may illustrate, but cannot prove it. The rule will of
course be confirmed by such trial, because what is true in
general is true in particular: but the rule cannot be proved
from any number of trials, for no accumulation of particular
cases makes up a universal case. To all persons who can see
the force of any proof, the geometrical rule above referred
to is as evident, and its evidence as independent of
experience, as the assertion that sixteen and nine make
twenty-five. At the same time, the truth of the geometrical
rule is quite independent of numerical truths, and results
from the relations of space alone. This could not be if our
apprehension of the relations of space were the fruit of
experience: for experience has no element from which such
truth and such proof could arise.</p>
<p id="b2c2s3">3. Thus the existence of necessary truths, such as those of
geometry, proves that the idea of space from <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page93">93</a></span> which they
flow is not derived from experience. Such truths are
inconceivable on the supposition of their being collected
from observation; for the impressions of sense include no
evidence of necessity. But we can readily understand the
necessary character of such truths, if we conceive that
there are certain necessary conditions under which alone the
mind receives the impressions of sense. Since these
conditions reside in the constitution of the mind, and apply
to every perception of an object to which the mind can
attain, we easily see that their rules must include, not
only all that has been, but all that can be, matter of
experience. Our sensations can each convey no information
except about itself; each can contain no trace of another
additional sensation; and thus no relation and connexion
between two sensations can be given by the sensations
themselves. But the mode in which the mind perceives these
impressions as objects, may and will introduce necessary
relations among them: and thus by conceiving the idea of
space to be a condition of perception in the mind, we can
conceive the existence of necessary truths, which apply to
all perceived objects.</p>
<p id="b2c2s4">4. If we consider the impressions of sense as the mere
materials of our experience, such materials may be
accumulated in any quantity and in any order. But if we
suppose that this matter has a certain form given it, in the
act of being accepted by the mind, we can understand how it
is that these materials are subject to inevitable rules;&#8212;how
nothing can be perceived exempt from the relations which
belong to such a form. And since there are such truths
applicable to our experience, and arising from the nature of
space, we may thus consider space as a <em>form</em> which
the materials given by experience necessarily assume in the
mind; as an arrangement derived from the perceiving mind,
and not from the sensations alone.</p>
<p id="b2c2s5">5. Thus this phrase,&#8212;that space is a <em>form</em>
belonging to our perceptive power,&#8212;may be employed to
express that we cannot perceive objects as in space, without
an operation of the mind as well as of the senses&#8212;without
active as well as passive faculties. This phrase, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page94">94</a></span> is not necessary to the exposition of our doctrines.
Whether we call the conception of space a Condition of
perception, a Form of perception, or an Idea, or by any
other term, it is something originally inherent in the mind
perceiving, and not in the objects perceived. And it is
because the apprehension of all objects is thus subjected to
certain mental conditions, forms or ideas, that our
knowledge involves certain inviolable relations and
necessary truths. The principles of such truths, so far as
they regard space, are derived from the idea of space, and
we must endeavour to exhibit such principles in their
general form. But before we do this, we may notice some of
the conditions which belong, not to our Ideas in general,
but to this Idea of Space in particular.</p>

<span class="sc">Of some Peculiarities of the Idea of Space.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b2c3s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> S</span>OME
of the Ideas which we shall have to examine involve
conceptions of certain relations of objects, as the idea of
Cause and of Likeness; and may appear to be suggested by
experience, enabling us to <em>abstract</em> this general relation
from particular cases. But it will be seen that Space is not
such a general conception of a relation. For we do not speak
of <i>Spaces</i> as we speak of Causes and Likenesses, but
of Space. And when we speak of <i>spaces</i>, we understand
by the expression, parts of one and the same identical
everywhere-extended Space. We conceive a universal Space;
which is not made up of these partial spaces as its
component parts, for it would remain if these were taken
away; and these cannot be conceived without presupposing
absolute space. Absolute Space is essentially one; and the
complication which exists in it, and the conception of
various spaces, depends merely upon boundaries. Space must,
therefore, be, as we have said, not a general conception
abstracted from particulars, but a universal mode of
representation, altogether independent of experience.</p>
<p id="b2c3s2">2. Space is infinite. We represent it to ourselves as an
infinitely great magnitude. Such an idea as that of Likeness
or Cause, is, no doubt, found in an infinite number of
particular cases, and so far includes these cases. But these
ideas do not include an infinite number of cases as parts of
an infinite whole. When we say that all bodies and partial
spaces exist <em>in</em> infinite space, we use an expression which
is not applied in the same sense to any cases except those
of Space and Time. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page96">96</a></span></p>
<p id="b2c3s3">3. What is here said may appear to be a denial of the real
existence of space. It must be observed, however, that we do
not deny, but distinctly assert, the existence of space as a
real and necessary condition of all objects perceived; and
that we not only allow that objects are seen external to us,
but we found upon the fact of their being so seen, our view
of the nature of space. If, however, it be said that we deny
the reality of space as an object or thing, this is true.
Nor does it appear easy to maintain that space exists as a
thing, when it is considered that this thing is infinite in
all its dimensions; and, moreover, that it is a thing,
which, being nothing in itself, exists only that other
things may exist in it. And those who maintain the real
existence of space, must also maintain the real existence of
time in the same sense. Now two infinite things, thus really
existing, and yet existing only as other things exist in
them, are notions so extravagant that we are driven to some
other mode of explaining the state of the matter.</p>
<p id="b2c3s4">4. Thus space is not an object of which we perceive the
properties, but a form of our perception; not a thing which
affects our senses, but an idea to which we conform the
impressions of sense. And its peculiarities appear to depend
upon this, that it is not only a form of sensation, but of
<em>intuition</em>; that in reference to space, we not only
perceive but <em>contemplate</em> objects. We see objects in
space, side by side, exterior to each other; space, and
objects in so far as they occupy space, have parts exterior
to other parts; and have the whole thus made up by the
juxtaposition of parts. This mode of apprehension belongs
only to the ideas of space and time. Space and Time are made
up of parts, but Cause and Likeness are not apprehended as
made up of parts. And the term <i>intuition</i> (in its
rigorous sense) is applicable only to that mode of
contemplation in which we thus look at objects as made up of
parts, and apprehend the relations of those parts at the
same time and by the same act by which we apprehend the
objects themselves.</p>
<p id="b2c3s5">5. As we have said, space limited by <em>boundaries</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page97">97</a></span> gives rise to various conceptions which we have often
to consider. Thus limited, space assumes <i>form</i> or
<i>figure</i>; and the variety of conceptions thus brought
under our notice is infinite. We have every possible form of
line, straight line, and curve; and of curves an endless
number;&#8212;circles, parabolas, hyperbolas, spirals, helices.
We have plane surfaces of various shapes,&#8212;parallelograms,
polygons, ellipses; and we have solid figures,&#8212;cubes,
cones, cylinders, spheres, spheroids, and so on. All these
have their various properties, depending on the relations of
their boundaries; and the investigation of their properties
forms the business of the science of Geometry.</p>
<p id="b2c3s6">6. Space has three dimensions, or directions in which it may
be measured; it cannot have more or fewer. The simplest
measurement is that of a straight line, which has length
alone. A surface has both length and breadth: and solid
space has length, breadth, and thickness or depth. The
origin of such a difference of dimensions will be seen if we
reflect that each portion of space has a boundary, and is
extended both <em>in</em> the direction in which its
boundary extends, and also in a direction <em>from</em> its
boundary; for otherwise it would not be a boundary. A point
has no dimensions. A line has but one dimension,&#8212;the
distance from its boundary, or its <i>length</i>. A plane,
bounded by a straight line, has the dimension which belongs
to this line, and also has another dimension arising from
the distance of its parts from this boundary line; and this
may be called <i>breadth</i>. A solid, bounded by a plane,
has the dimensions which this plane has; and has also a
third dimension, which we may call <i>height</i> or
<i>depth</i>, as we consider the solid extended above or
below the plane; or <i>thickness</i>, if we omit all
consideration of up and down. And no space can have any
dimensions which are not resoluble into these three.</p>
<p>We may now proceed to consider the mode in which the idea of
space is employed in the formation of Geometry.</p>

<p class="noind" id="b2c4s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
relations of space have been apprehended with
peculiar distinctness and clearness from the very first
unfolding of man’s speculative powers. This was a
consequence of the circumstance which we have just noticed,
that the simplest of these relations, and those on which the
others depend, are seen by intuition. Hence, as soon as men
were led to speculate concerning the relations of space,
they assumed just principles, and obtained true results. It
is said that the science of <i>geometry</i> had its origin
in Egypt, before the dawn of the Greek philosophy: but the
knowledge of the early Egyptians (exclusive of their
mythology) appears to have been purely practical; and,
probably, their geometry consisted only in some maxims of
<i>land-measuring</i>, which is what the term implies. The
Greeks of the time of Plato, had, however, not only
possessed themselves of many of the most remarkable
elementary theorems of the science; but had, in several
instances, reached the boundary of the science in its
elementary form; as when they proposed to themselves the
problems of doubling the cube and squaring the circle.</p>
<p>But the deduction of these theorems by a systematic process,
and the primary exhibition of the simplest principles
involved in the idea of space, which such a deduction
requires, did not take place, so far as we are aware, till a
period somewhat later. The <i>Elements of Geometry</i> of
Euclid, in which this task was performed, are to this day
the standard work on the subject: the author of this work
taught mathematics with great applause at Alexandria, in the
reign of Ptolemy Lagus, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page99">99</a></span> about 280 years before Christ.
The principles which Euclid makes the basis of his system
have been very little simplified since his time; and all the
essays and controversies which bear upon these principles,
have had a reference to the form in which they are stated by
him.</p>
<p id="b2c4s2">2. <i>Definitions.</i>&#8212;The first principles of Euclid’s
geometry are, as the first principles of any system of
geometry must be, definitions and axioms respecting the
various ideal conceptions which he introduces; as straight
lines, parallel lines, angles, circles, and the like. But it
is to be observed that these definitions and axioms are very
far from being arbitrary hypotheses and assumptions. They
have their origin in the idea of space, and are merely modes
of exhibiting that idea in such a manner as to make it
afford grounds of deductive reasoning. The axioms are
necessary consequences of the conceptions respecting which
they are asserted; and the definitions are no less necessary
limitations of conceptions; not requisite in order to arrive
at this or that consequence; but necessary in order that it
may be possible to draw any consequences, and to establish
any general truths.</p>
<p>For example, if we rest the end of one straight staff upon
the middle of another straight staff, and move the first
staff into various positions, we, by so doing, alter the
angles which the first staff makes with the other to the
right hand and to the left. But if we place the staff in
that special position in which these two angles are equal,
each of them is a right angle, according to Euclid; and this
is the <i>definition</i> of a right angle, except that
Euclid employs the abstract conception of straight lines,
instead of speaking, as we have done, of staves. But this
selection of the case in which the two angles are equal is
not a mere act of caprice; as it might have been if he had
selected a case in which these angles are unequal in any
proportion. For the consequences which can be drawn
concerning the cases of unequal angles, do not lead to
general truths, without some reference to that peculiar case
in which the angles are equal: and thus it becomes necessary
to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page100">100</a></span> single out and define that special case, marking it
by a special phrase. And this definition not only gives
complete and distinct knowledge what a right angle is, to
any one who can form the conception of an angle in general;
but also supplies a principle from which all the properties
of right angles may be deduced.</p>
<p id="b2c4s3">3. <i>Axioms.</i>&#8212;With regard to other conceptions also, as
circles, squares, and the like, it is possible to lay down
definitions which are a sufficient basis for our reasoning,
so far as such figures are concerned. But, besides these
definitions, it has been found necessary to introduce
certain axioms among the fundamental principles of geometry.
These are of the simplest character; for instance, that two
straight lines cannot cut each other in more than one point,
and an axiom concerning parallel lines. Like the
definitions, these axioms flow from the Idea of Space, and
present that idea under various aspects. They are different
from the definitions; nor can the definitions be made to
take the place of the axioms in the reasoning by which
elementary geometrical properties are established. For
example, the definition of parallel straight lines is, that
they are such as, however far continued, can never meet:
but, in order to reason concerning such lines, we must
further adopt some axiom respecting them: for example, we
may very conveniently take this axiom; that two straight
lines which cut one another are not both of them parallel to
a third straight line<a id="fnanchor1-2" href="#note1-2"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>. The definition and the axiom are
seen to be inseparably connected by our intuition of the
properties of space; but the axiom cannot be proved from the
definition, by any rigorous deductive demonstration. And if
we were to take any other definition of two parallel
straight lines, (as that they are both perpendicular to a
third straight line,) we should still, at some point or
other of our progress, fall in with the same difficulty of
demonstratively establishing their properties without some
further assumption.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-2" href="#fnanchor1-2">1</a></span> This axiom is simpler and more convenient than
that of Euclid. It is employed by the late Professor
Playfair in his <i>Geometry</i>.</div>
<p id="b2c4s4"><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page101">101</a></span> 4. Thus the elementary properties of figures, which
are the basis of our geometry, are necessary results of our
Idea of Space; and are connected with each other by the
nature of that idea, and not merely by our hypotheses and
constructions. Definitions and axioms must be combined, in
order to express this idea so far as the purposes of
demonstrative reasoning require. These verbal enunciations
of the results of the idea cannot be made to depend on each
other by logical consequence; but have a mutual dependence
of a more intimate kind, which words cannot fully convey. It
is not possible to resolve these truths into certain
<i>hypotheses</i>, of which all the rest shall be the
necessary logical consequence. The necessity is not
hypothetical, but intuitive. The axioms require not to be
granted, but to be seen. If any one were to assent to them
without seeing them to be true, his assent would be of no
avail for purposes of reasoning: for he would be also unable
to see in what cases they might be applied. The clear
possession of the Idea of Space is the first requisite for
all geometrical reasoning; and this clearness of idea may be
tested by examining whether the axioms offer themselves to
the mind as evident.</p>
<p id="b2c4s5">5. The necessity of ideas added to sensations, in order to
produce knowledge, has often been overlooked or denied in
modern times. The ground of necessary truth which ideas
supply being thus lost, it was conceived that there still
remained a ground of necessity in definitions;&#8212;that we
might have necessary truths, by asserting especially what
the definition implicitly involved in general. It was held,
also, that this was the case in geometry:&#8212;that all the
properties of a circle, for instance, were implicitly
contained in the definition of a circle. That this alone is
not the ground of the necessity of the truths which regard
the circle,&#8212;that we could not in this way unfold a
definition into proportions, without possessing an intuition
of the relations to which the definition led,&#8212;has already
been shown. But the insufficiency of the above account of
the grounds of necessary geometrical truth appeared in
another way also. It was found impossible to lay <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page102">102</a></span> down
a system of definitions out of which alone the whole of
geometrical truth could be evolved. It was found that axioms
could not be superseded. No definition of a straight line
could be given which rendered the axiom concerning straight
lines superfluous. And thus it appeared that the source of
geometrical truths was not definition alone; and we find in
this result a confirmation of the doctrine which we are here
urging, that this source of truth is to be found in the form
or conditions of our perception;&#8212;in the idea which we
unavoidably combine with the impressions of sense;&#8212;in the
activity, and not in the passivity of the mind<a id="fnanchor2-2" href="#note2-2"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-2" href="#fnanchor2-2">2</a></span> I formerly stated views similar to these in some
‘Remarks’ appended to a work which I termed <i>The
Mechanical Euclid</i>, published in 1837. These Remarks, so
far as they bear upon the question here discussed, were
noticed and controverted in No. 135 of the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>. As an examination of the reviewer’s objections
may serve further to illustrate the subject, I shall <a href="#v1page107">annex</a>
to this chapter an answer to the article to which I have
referred.</div>
<p id="b2c4s6">6. This will appear further when we come to consider the
mode in which we exercise our observation upon the relations
of space. But we may, in the first place, make a remark
which tends to show the connexion between our conception of
a straight line, and the axiom which is made the foundation
of our reasonings concerning space. The axiom is this;&#8212;that
two straight lines, which have both their ends joined,
cannot have the intervening parts separated so as to inclose
a space. The necessity of this axiom is of exactly the same
kind as the necessity of the definition of a right angle, of
which we have already spoken. For as the line standing on
another makes <i>right angles</i> when it makes the angles
on the two sides of it equal; so a line is a <i>straight
line</i> when it makes the two portions of space, on the two
sides of it, similar. And as there is only a single position
of the line first mentioned, which can make the angles
equal, so there is only a single form of a line which can
make the spaces near the line similar on one side and on the
other: and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page103">103</a></span> therefore there cannot be two straight
lines, such as the axiom describes, which, between the same
limits, give two different boundaries to space thus
separated. And thus we see a reason for the axiom. Perhaps
this view may be further elucidated if we take a leaf of
paper, double it, and crease the folded edge. We shall thus
obtain a straight line at the folded edge; and this line
divides the surface of the paper, as it was originally
spread out, into two similar spaces. And that these spaces
are similar so far as the fold which separates them is
concerned, appears from this;&#8212;that these two parts coincide
when the paper is doubled. And thus a fold in a sheet of
paper at the same time illustrates the definition of a
straight line according to the above view, and confirms the
axiom that two such lines cannot inclose a space.</p>
<p>If the separation of the two parts of space were made by any
other than a straight line; if, for instance, the paper were
cut by a concave line; then, on turning one of the parts
over, it is easy to see that the edge of one part being
concave one way, and the edge of the other part concave the
other way, these two lines would enclose a space. And each
of them would divide the whole space into two portions which
were not similar; for one portion would have a concave edge,
and the other a convex edge. Between any two points, there
might be innumerable lines drawn, some, convex one way, and
some, convex the other way; but the straight line is the
line which is not convex either one way or the other; it is
the single medium standard from which the others may deviate
in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Such considerations as these show sufficiently that the
singleness of the straight line which connects any two
points is a result of our fundamental conceptions of space.
But yet the above conceptions of the similar form of the two
parts of space on the two sides of a line, and of the form
of a line which is intermediate among all other forms, are
of so vague a nature, that they cannot fitly be made the
basis of our elementary geometry; and they are far more
conveniently replaced, as they have been in almost all
treatises of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page104">104</a></span> geometry, by the axiom, that two straight
lines cannot inclose a space.</p>
<p id="b2c4s7">7. But we may remark that, in what precedes, we have
considered space only under one of its aspects:&#8212;as a plane.
The sheet of paper which we assumed in order to illustrate
the nature of a straight line, was supposed to be perfectly
<i>plane</i> or <i>flat</i>: for otherwise, by folding it,
we might obtain a line not straight. Now this assumption of
a plane appears to take for granted that very conception of
a straight line which the sheet was employed to illustrate;
for the definition of a plane given in the Elements of
Geometry is, that it is a surface on which lie all straight
lines drawn from one point of the surface to another. And
thus the explanation above given of the nature of a straight
line,&#8212;that it divides a plane space into similar portions on
each side,&#8212;appears to be imperfect or nugatory.</p>
<p>To this we reply, that the explanation must be rendered
complete and valid by deriving the conception of a plane
from considerations of the same kind as those which we
employed for a straight line. Any portion of solid space may
be divided into two portions by surfaces passing through any
given line or boundaries. And these surfaces may be convex
either on one side or on the other, and they admit of
innumerable changes from being convex on one side to being
convex on the other in any degree. So long as the surface is
convex either way, the two portions of space which it
separates are not similar, one having a convex and the other
a concave boundary. But there is a certain intermediate
position of the surface, in which position the two portions
of space which it divides have their boundaries exactly
similar. In this position, the surface is neither convex nor
concave, but plane. And thus a plane surface is determined
by this condition&#8212;of its being that single surface which is
the intermediate form among all convex and concave surfaces
by which solid space can be divided,&#8212;and of its separating
such space into two portions, of which the boundaries,
though they are the same surface in two opposite positions,
are exactly similar. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page105">105</a></span></p>
<p>Thus a plane is the simplest and most symmetrical boundary
by which a solid can be divided; and a straight line is the
simplest and most symmetrical boundary by which a plane can
be separated. These conceptions are obtained by considering
the boundaries of an interminable space, capable of
imaginary division in every direction. And as a limited
space may be separated into two parts by a plane, and a
plane again separated into two parts by a straight line, so
a line is divided into two portions by a point, which is the
common boundary of the two portions; the end of the one and
the beginning of the other portion having itself no
magnitude, form, or parts.</p>
<p id="b2c4s8">8. The geometrical properties of planes and solids are
deducible from the first principles of the Elements, without
any new axioms; the definition of a plane above quoted,&#8212;that
all straight lines joining its points lie in the
plane,&#8212;being a sufficient basis for all reasoning upon
these subjects. And thus, the views which we have presented
of the nature of space being verbally expressed by means of
certain definitions and axioms, become the groundwork of a
long series of deductive reasoning, by which is established
a very large and curious collection of truths, namely, the
whole science of Elementary Plane and Solid Geometry.</p>
<p>This science is one of indispensable use and constant
reference, for every student of the laws of nature; for the
relations of space and number are the <em>alphabet</em> in
which those laws are written. But besides the interest and
importance of this kind which geometry possesses, it has a
great and peculiar value for all who wish to understand the
foundations of human knowledge, and the methods by which it
is acquired. For the student of geometry acquires, with a
degree of insight and clearness which the unmathematical
reader can but feebly imagine, a conviction that there are
necessary truths, many of them of a very complex and
striking character; and that a few of the most simple and
self-evident truths which it is possible for the mind of man
to apprehend, may, by systematic deduction, lead to the most
remote and unexpected results. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page106">106</a></span></p>
<p>In pursuing such philosophical researches as that in which
we are now engaged, it is of great advantage to the
speculator to have cultivated to some extent the study of
geometry; since by this study he may become fully aware of
such features in human knowledge as those which we have
mentioned. By the aid of the lesson thus learned from the
contemplation of geometrical truths, we have been
endeavouriug to establish those further doctrines;&#8212;that
these truths are but different aspects of the same
Fundamental Idea, and that the grounds of the necessity
which these truths possess reside in the Idea from which
they flow, this Idea not being a derivative result of
experience, but its primary rule. When the reader has
obtained a clear and satisfactory view of these doctrines,
so far as they are applicable to our knowledge concerning
space, he has, we may trust, overcome the main difficulty
which will occur in following the course of the speculations
now presented to him. He is then prepared to go forwards
with us; to see over how wide a field the same doctrines are
applicable: and how rich and various a harvest of knowledge
springs from these seemingly scanty principles.</p>
<p>But before we quit the subject now under our consideration,
we shall endeavour to answer some objections which have been
made to the views here presented; and shall attempt to
illustrate further the active powers which we have ascribed
to the mind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br/><br/>

<hr class="two" /><br/>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-2" href="#fnanchor3-2">3</a></span> In order to render the present chapter more
intelligible, it may be proper to state briefly the
arguments which gave occasion to the review. After noticing
Stewart’s assertions, that the certainty of mathematical
reasoning arises from its depending upon definitions, and
that mathematical truth is hypothetical; I urged,&#8212;that no
one has yet been able to construct a system of mathematical
truths by the aid of definitions alone; that a definition
would not be admissible or applicable except it agreed with
a distinct conception in the mind; that the definitions
which we employ in mathematics are not arbitrary or
hypothetical, but necessary definitions; that if Stewart had
taken as his examples of axioms the peculiar geometrical
axioms, his assertions would have been obviously erroneous;
and that the real foundation of the truths of mathematics is
the Idea of Space, which may be expressed (for purposes of
demonstration) partly by definitions and partly by axioms.</div>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, No. cxxxv., contains a critique
on a work termed <i>The Mechanical Euclid</i>, in which
opinions were delivered to nearly the same effect as some of
those stated in the last chapter, and hereafter in Chapter
xi. Although I believe that there are no arguments used by
the reviewer to which the answers will not suggest
themselves in the mind of any one who has read with
attention what has been said in the preceding chapters
(except, perhaps, one or two remarks which have reference to
mechanical ideas), it may serve to illustrate the subject if
I reply to the objections directly, taking them as the
reviewer has stated them.</p>
<p id="b2c5s1">I. I had dissented from Stewart’s assertion that
mathematical truth is hypothetical, or depends upon
arbitrary definitions; since we understand by an <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page108">108</a></span>
hypothesis a supposition, not only which we may make, but
may abstain from making, or may replace by a different
supposition; whereas the definitions and hypotheses of
geometry are necessarily such as they are, and cannot be
altered or excluded. The reviewer (p. 84) informs us that he
understands Stewart, when he speaks of hypotheses and
definitions being the foundation of geometry, to speak of
the hypothesis that real objects correspond to our
geometrical definitions. ‘<em>If</em> a crystal be an exact
hexahedron, the geometrical properties of the hexahedron may
be predicated of that crystal.’ To this I reply,&#8212;that such
hypotheses as this are the grounds of our applications of
geometrical truths to real objects, but can in no way be
said to be the foundation of the truths themselves;&#8212;that I
do not think that the sense which the reviewer gives was
Stewart’s meaning;&#8212;but that if it was, this view of the use
of mathematics does not at all affect the question which
both he and I proposed to discuss, which was, the ground of
mathematical certainty. I may add, that whether a crystal be
an exact hexahedron, is a matter of observation and
measurement, not of definition. I think the reader can have
no difficulty in seeing how little my doctrine is affected
by the connexion on which the reviewer thus insists. I have
asserted that the proposition which affirms the square on
the diagonal of a rectangle to be equal to the squares on
two sides, does not rest upon arbitrary hypotheses; the
objector answers, that the proposition that the square on
the diagonal <i>of this page</i> is equal to the squares on
the sides, depends upon the arbitrary hypothesis that the
page is a rectangle. Even if this fact were a matter of
arbitrary hypothesis, what could it have to do with the
general geometrical proposition? How could a single fact,
observed or hypothetical, affect a universal and necessary
truth, which would be equally true if the fact were false?
If there be nothing arbitrary or hypothetical in geometry
till we come to such steps in its application, it is plain
that the truths themselves are not hypothetical; which is
the question for us to decide. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page109">109</a></span></p>
<p id="b2c5s2">2. The reviewer then (p. 85) considers the doctrine that
axioms as well as definitions are the foundations of
geometry; and here he strangely narrows and confuses the
discussion by making himself the advocate of Stewart,
instead of arguing the question itself. I had asserted that
some axioms are necessary as the foundations of mathematical
reasoning, in addition to the definitions. If Stewart did
not intend to discuss this question, I had no concern with
what he had said about axioms. But I had every reason to
believe that this was the question which Stewart did intend
to discuss. I conceive there is no doubt that he intended to
give an opinion upon the grounds of mathematical reasoning
in general. For he begins his discussions (<i>Elements</i>,
vol. ii. p. 38) by contesting Reid’s opinion on this
subject, which is stated generally; and he refers again to
the same subject, asserting in general terms, that the first
principles of mathematics are not axioms but definitions.
If, then, afterwards, he made his proof narrower than his
assertion;&#8212;if having declared that no axioms are necessary,
he afterwards limited himself to showing that seven out of
twelve of Euclid’s axioms are barren truisms, it was no
concern of mine to contest this assertion, which left my
thesis untouched. I had asserted that the proper geometrical
axioms (that two straight lines cannot inclose a space, and
the axiom about parallel lines) are indispensable in
geometry. What account the reviewer gives of these axioms we
shall soon see; but if Stewart allowed them to be axioms
necessary to geometrical reasoning, he overturned his own
assertion as to the foundations of such reasoning; and if he
said nothing decisive about these axioms, which are the
points on which the battle must turn, he left his assertion
altogether unproved; nor was it necessary for me to pursue
the war into a barren and unimportant corner, when the
metropolis was surrendered. The reviewer’s exultation that I
have not contested the first seven axioms is an amusing
example of the self-complacent zeal of advocacy.</p>
<p id="b2c5s3">3. But let us turn to the material point,&#8212;the proper
geometrical axioms. What is the reviewer’s account of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page110">110</a></span>
these? Which side of the alternative does he adopt? Do they
depend upon the definitions, and is he prepared to show the
dependence? Or are they superfluous, and can he erect the
structure of geometry without their aid? One of these two
courses, it would seem, he must take. For we both begin by
asserting the excellence of geometry as an example of
demonstrated truth. It is precisely this attribute which
gives an interest to our present inquiry. How, then, does
the reviewer explain this excellence on his views? How does
he reckon the foundation courses of the edifice which we
agree in considering as a perfect example of intellectual
building?</p>
<p>I presume I may take, as his answer to this question, his
hypothetical statement of what Stewart would have said (p.
87), on the supposition that there had been, among the
foundations of geometry, self-evident indemonstrable truths:
although it is certainly strange that the reviewer should
not venture to make up his mind as to the truth or falsehood
of this supposition. If there were such truths they would
be, he says, ‘legitimate filiations’ of the definitions.
They would be involved in the definitions. And again he
speaks of the foundation of the geometrical doctrine of
parallels as a flaw, and as a truth which requires, but has
not received demonstration. And yet again, he tells us that
each of these supposed axioms (Euclid’s twelfth, for
instance) is ‘merely an indication of the point at which
geometry fails to perform that which it undertakes to
perform’ (p. 91); and that in reality her truths are not yet
demonstrated. The amount of this is, that the geometrical
axioms are to be held to be <em>legitimate filiations</em> of the
definitions, because though certainly true, they cannot be
proved from the definitions; that they are involved in the
definitions, although they cannot be evolved out of them;
and that rather than admit that they have any other origin
than the definitions, we are to proclaim that geometry has
failed to perform what she undertakes to perform.</p>
<p>To this I reply&#8212;that I cannot understand what is meant by
‘legitimate filiations’ of principles, if the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page111">111</a></span> phrase
do not mean consequences of such principles established by
rigorous and formal demonstrations;&#8212;that the reviewer, if
he claims any real signification for his phrase, must
substantiate the meaning of it by such a demonstration; he
must establish his ‘legitimate filiation’ by a genealogical
table in a satisfactory form. When this cannot be done, to
assert, notwithstanding, that the propositions are involved
in the definitions, is a mere begging the question; and to
excuse this defect by saying that geometry fails to perform
what she has promised, is to calumniate the character of
that science which we profess to make our standard, rather
than abandon an arbitrary and unproved assertion respecting
the real grounds of her excellence. I add, further, that if
the doctrine of parallel lines, or any other geometrical
doctrine of which we see the truth, with the most perfect
insight of its necessity, have not hitherto received
demonstration to the satisfaction of any school of
reasoners, the defect must arise from their erroneous views
of the nature of demonstrations, and the grounds of
mathematical certainty.</p>
<p id="b2c5s4">4. I conceive, then, that the reviewer has failed altogether
to disprove the doctrine that the axioms of geometry are
necessary as a part of the foundations of the science. I had
asserted further that these axioms supply what the
definitions leave deficient; and that they, along with
definitions, serve to present the idea of space under such
aspects that we can reason logically concerning it. To this
the reviewer opposes (p. 96) the common opinion that a
perfect definition is a complete explanation of a name, and
that the test of its perfection is, that we may substitute
the definition for the name wherever it occurs. I reply,
that my doctrine, that a definition expresses a part, but
not the whole, of the essential characters of an idea, is
certainly at variance with an opinion sometimes maintained,
that a definition merely explains a word, and should explain
it so fully that it may always replace it. The error of this
common opinion may, I think, be shown from considerations
such as these;&#8212;that if <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page112">112</a></span> we undertake to explain one
word by several, we may be called upon, on the same ground,
to explain each of these several by others, and that in this
way we can reach no limit nor resting-place;&#8212;that in point
of fact, it is not found to lead to clearness, but to
obscurity, when in the discussion of general principles, we
thus substitute definitions for single terms;&#8212;that even if
this be done, we cannot reason without conceiving what the
terms mean;&#8212;and that, in doing this, the relations of our
conceptions, and not the arbitrary equivalence of two forms
of expression, are the foundations of our reasoning.</p>
<p id="b2c5s5">5. The reviewer conceives that some of the so-called axioms
are really definitions. The axiom, that ‘magnitudes which
coincide with each other, that is, which fill the same
space, are equal,’ is a definition of geometrical
<i>equality</i>: the axiom, that ‘the whole is greater than
its part,’ is a definition of <i>whole</i> and <i>part</i>.
But surely there are very serious objections to this view.
It would seem more natural to say, if the former axiom is a
definition of the word <i>equal</i>, that the latter is a
definition of the word <i>greater</i>. And how can one short
phrase define two terms? If I say, ‘the heat of summer is
greater than the heat of winter,’ does this assertion define
anything, though the proposition is perfectly intelligible
and distinct? I think, then, that this attempt to reduce
these axioms to definitions is quite untenable.</p>
<p id="b2c5s6">6. I have stated that a definition can be of no use, except
we can conceive the possibility and truth of the property
connected with it; and that if we do conceive this, we may
rightly begin our reasonings by stating the property as an
axiom; which Euclid does, in the case of straight lines and
of parallels. The reviewer inquires (p. 92), whether I am
prepared to extend this doctrine to the case of circles, for
which the reasoning is usually rested upon the
definition;&#8212;whether I would replace this definition by an
axiom, asserting the possibility of such a circle. To this I
might reply, that it is not at all incumbent upon me to
assent to such a change; for I have all along stated that it
is indifferent <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page113">113</a></span> whether the fundamental properties from
which we reason be exhibited as definitions or as axioms,
provided the necessity be clearly seen. But I am ready to
declare that I think the form of our geometry would be not
at all the worse, if, instead of the usual definition of a
circle,&#8212;‘that it is a figure contained by one line, which
is called the circumference, and which is such, that all
straight lines drawn from a certain point within the
circumference are equal to one another,’&#8212;we were to
substitute an axiom and a definition, as follows:&#8212;<br/>
&#8195;<i>Axiom</i>. If a line be drawn so as to be at every point
equally distant from a certain point, this line will return
into itself or will be <em>one</em> line including a space.<br/>
&#8195;<i>Definition</i>. The space is called a <i>circle</i>, the
line the <i>circumference</i>, and the point the
<i>center</i>.</p>
<p>And this being done, it would be true, as the reviewer
remarks, that geometry cannot stir <em>one</em> step without resting
on an axiom. And I do not at all hesitate to say, that the
above axiom, expressed or understood, is no less necessary
than the definition, and is tacitly assumed in every
proposition into which circles enter.</p>
<p id="b2c5s7">7. I have, I think, now disposed of the principal objections
which bear upon the proper axioms of geometry. The
principles which are stated as the first seven axioms of
Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>, need not, as I have said, be here
discussed. They are principles which refer, not to Space in
particular, but to Quantity in general: such, for instance,
as these; ‘If equals be added to equals the wholes are
equal;’&#8212;‘If equals be taken from equals the remainders are
equal.’ But I will make an observation or two upon them
before I proceed.</p>
<p>Both Locke and Stewart have spoken of these axioms as barren
truisms: as propositions from which it is not possible to
deduce a single inference: and the reviewer asserts that
they are not first principles, but laws of thought (p. 88).
To this last expression I am <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page114">114</a></span> willing to assent; but I
would add, that not only these, but all the principles which
express the fundamental conditions of our knowledge, may
with equal propriety be termed laws of thought; for these
principles depend upon our ideas, and regulate the active
operations of the mind, by which coherence and connexion are
given to its passive impressions. But the assertion that no
conclusions can be drawn from simple axioms, or laws of
human thought, which regard quantity, is by no means true.
The whole of arithmetic,&#8212;for instance, the rules for the
multiplication and division of large numbers, the rule for
finding a common measure, and, in short, a vast body of
theory respecting numbers,&#8212;rests upon no other foundation
than such axioms as have been just noticed, that if equals
be added to equals the wholes will be equal. And even when
Locke’s assertion, that from these axioms no truths can be
deduced, is modified by Stewart and the reviewer, and
limited to <em>geometrical</em> truths, it is hardly tenable
(although, in fact, it matters little to our argument
whether it is or no). For the greater part of the Seventh
Book of Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>, (on Commensurable and
Incommensurable Quantities,) and the Fifth Book, (on
Proportion,) depend upon these axioms, with the addition
only of the definition or axiom (for it may be stated either
way) which expresses the idea of proportionality in numbers.
So that the attempt to disprove the necessity and use of
axioms, as principles of reasoning, fails even when we take
those instances which the opponents consider as the more
manifestly favourable to their doctrine.</p>
<p id="b2c5s8">8. But perhaps the question may have already suggested
itself to the reader’s mind, of what use can it be formally
to state such principles as these, (for example, that if
equals be added to equals the wholes are equal,) since,
whether stated or no, they will be assumed in our reasoning?
And how can such principles be said to be necessary, when
our proof proceeds equally well without any reference to
them? And the answer is, that it is precisely because these
are the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page115">115</a></span> common principles of reasoning, which we
naturally employ without specially contemplating them, that
they require to be separated from the other steps and
formally stated, when we <em>analyse</em> the demonstrations which we
have obtained. In every mental process many principles are
combined and abbreviated, and thus in some measure concealed
and obscured. In analysing these processes, the combination
must be resolved, and the abbreviation expanded, and thus
the appearance is presented of a pedantic and superfluous
formality. But that which is superfluous for proof, is
necessary for the analysis of proof. In order to exhibit the
conditions of demonstration distinctly, they must be
exhibited formally. In the same manner, in demonstration we
do not usually express every step in the form of a
syllogism, but we see the grounds of the conclusiveness of a
demonstration, by resolving it into syllogisms. Neither
axioms nor syllogisms are necessary for conviction; but they
are necessary to display the conditions under which
conviction becomes inevitable. The application of a single
one of the axioms just spoken of is so minute a step in the
proof, that it appears pedantic to give it a marked place;
but the very essence of demonstration consists in this, that
it is composed of an indissoluble succession of such minute
steps. The admirable circumstance is, that by the
accumulation of such apparently imperceptible advances, we
can in the end make so vast and so sure a progress. The
completeness of the analysis of our knowledge appears in the
smallness of the elements into which it is thus resolved.
The minuteness of any of these elements of truth, of axioms
for instance, does not prevent their being as essential as
others which are more obvious. And any attempt to assume one
kind of element only, when the course of our analysis brings
before us two or more kinds, is altogether unphilosophical.
Axioms and definitions are the proximate constituent
principles of our demonstrations; and the intimate bond
which connects together a definition and an axiom on the
same subject is not truly expressed <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page116">116</a></span> by asserting the
latter to be derived from the former. This bond of connexion
exists in the mind of the reasoner, in his conception of
<em>that</em> to which both definition and axiom refer, and
consequently in the general Fundamental Idea of which that
conception is a modification.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Perception of Space.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b2c6s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> A</span>CCORDING
to the views above explained, certain of the
impressions of our senses convey to us the perception of
objects as existing in space; inasmuch as by the
constitution of our minds we cannot receive those
impressions otherwise than in a certain form, involving such
a manner of existence. But the question deserves to be
asked, <em>What</em> are the impressions of sense by which
we thus become acquainted with space and its relations? And
as we have seen that this idea of space implies an act of
the mind as well as an impression on the sense, what
manifestations do we find of this activity of the mind, in
our observation of the external world?</p>
<p>It is evident that sight and touch are the senses by which
the relations of space are perceived, principally or
entirely. It does not appear that an odour, or a feeling of
warmth or cold, would, independently of experience, suggest
to us the conception of a space surrounding us. But when we
<em>see</em> objects, we see that they are extended and
occupy space; when we <em>touch</em> them, we feel that they
are in a space in which we also are. We have before our eyes
any object, for instance, a board covered with geometrical
diagrams; and we distinctly perceive, by vision, those lines
of which the relations are the subjects of our mathematical
reasoning. Again, we see before us a solid object, a cubical
box for instance; we see that it is within reach; we stretch
out the hand and perceive by the touch that it has sides,
edges, corners, which we had already perceived by vision. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page118">118</a></span></p>
<p id="b2c6s2">2. Probably most persons do not generally apprehend that
there is any material difference in these two cases;&#8212;that
there are any different acts of mind concerned in perceiving
by sight a mathematical diagram upon paper, and a solid cube
lying on a table. Yet it is not difficult to show that, in
the latter case at least, the perception of the shape of the
object is not immediate. A very little attention teaches us
that there is an act of judgment as well as a mere
impression of sense requisite, in order that we may see any
solid object. For there is no visible appearance which is
inseparably connected with solidity. If a picture of a cube
be rightly drawn, in perspective and skilfully shaded, the
impression upon the sense is the same as if it were a real
cube. The picture may be mistaken for a solid object. But it
is clear that, in this case, the solidity is given to the
object by an act of mental judgment. All that is seen is
outline and shade, figures and colours on a flat board. The
solid angles and edges, the relation of the faces of the
figure by which they form a cube, are matters of inference.
This, which is evident in the case of the pictured cube, is
true in all vision whatever. We see a scene before us on
which are various figures and colours, but the eye cannot
see more. It sees length and breadth, but no third
dimension. In order to know that there are solids, we must
infer as well as see. And this we do readily and constantly;
so familiarly, indeed, that we do not perceive the
operation. Yet we may detect this latent process in many
ways; for instance, by attending to cases in which the habit
of drawing such inferences misleads us. Most persons have
experienced this delusion in looking at a scene in a
theatre, and especially that kind of scene which is called a
<i>diorama</i>, when the interior of a building is
represented. In these cases, the perspective representations
of the various members of the architecture and decoration
impress us almost irresistibly with the conviction that we
have before us a space of great extent and complex form,
instead of a flat painted canvass. Here, at least, the space
is our own creation; but yet here, it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page119">119</a></span> manifestly
created by the same act of thought as if we were really in
the palace or the cathedral of which the halls and aisles
thus seem to inclose us. And the act by which we thus create
space of three dimensions out of visible extent of length
and breadth, is constantly and imperceptibly going on. We
are perpetually interpreting in this manner the language of
the visible world. From the appearances of things which we
directly see, we are constantly inferring that which we
cannot directly see,&#8212;their distance from us, and the
position of their parts.</p>
<p id="b2c6s3">3. The characters which we thus interpret are various. They
are, for instance, the visible forms, colours, and shades of
the parts, understood according to the maxims of
perspective; (for of perspective every one has a practical
knowledge, as every one has of grammar;) the effort by which
we fix both our eyes on the same object, and adjust each eye
to distinct vision; and the like. The right interpretation
of the information which such circumstances give us
respecting the true forms and distances of things, is
gradually learned; the lesson being begun in our earliest
infancy, and inculcated upon us every hour during which we
use our eyes. The completeness with which the lesson is
mastered is truly admirable; for we forget that our
conclusion is obtained indirectly, and mistake a judgment on
evidence for an intuitive perception. We see the breadth of
the street, as clearly and readily as we see the house on
the other side of it; and we see the house to be square,
however obliquely it be presented to us. This, however, by
no means throws any doubt or difficulty on the doctrine that
in all these cases we do interpret and infer. The rapidity
of the process, and the unconsciousness of the effort, are
not more remarkable in this case than they are when we
understand the meaning of the speech which we hear, or of
the book which we read. In these latter cases we merely hear
noises or see black marks; but we make, out of these
elements, thought and feeling, without being aware of the
act by which we do so. And by an exactly similar process we
see a variously-coloured <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page120">120</a></span> expanse, and collect from it
a space occupied by solid objects. In both cases the act of
interpretation is become so habitual that we can hardly stop
short at the mere impression of sense.</p>
<p id="b2c6s4">4. But yet there are various ways in which we may satisfy
ourselves that these two parts of the process of seeing
objects are distinct. To separate these operations is
precisely the task which the artist has to execute, in
making a drawing of what he sees. He has to recover the
consciousness of his real and genuine sensations, and to
discern the lines of objects as they appear. This at first
he finds difficult; for he is tempted to draw what he knows
of the forms of visible objects, and not what he sees: but
as he improves in his art, he learns to put on paper what he
sees only, separated from what he infers, in order that thus
the inference, and with it a conception like that of the
reality, may be left to the spectator. And thus the natural
process of vision is the habit of seeing that which cannot
be seen; and the difficulty of the art of drawing consists
in learning not to see more than is visible.</p>
<p id="b2c6s5">5. But again; even in the simplest drawing we exhibit
something which we do not see. However slight is our
representation of objects, it contains something which we
create for ourselves. For we draw an <em>outline</em>. Now
an outline has no existence in nature. There are no visible
lines presented to the eye by a group of figures. We
separate each figure from the rest, and the boundary by
which we do this is the outline of the figure; and the like
may be said of each member of every figure. A painter of our
own times has made this remark in a work upon his art<a id="fnanchor4-2" href="#note4-2"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>:
‘The effect which natural objects produce upon our sense of
vision is that of a number of parts, or distinct masses of
form and colour, and not of lines. But when we endeavour to
represent by painting the objects which are before us, or
which invention supplies to our minds, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page121">121</a></span> the first and
the simplest means we resort to is this picture, by which we
separate the form of each object from those that surround
it, marking its boundary, the extreme extent of its
dimensions in every direction, as impressed on our vision:
and this is termed drawing its outline.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-2" href="#fnanchor4-2">4</a></span> Phillips <i>On Painting.</i></div>
<p id="b2c6s6">6. Again, there are other ways in which we see clear
manifestations of the act of thought by which we assign to
the parts of objects their relations in space, the
impressions of sense being merely subservient to this act.
If we look at a medal through a glass which inverts it, we
see the figures upon it become concave depressions instead
of projecting convexities; for the light which illuminates
the nearer side of the convexity will be transferred to the
opposite side by the apparent inversion of the medal, and
will thus imply a hollow in which the side nearest the light
gathers the shade. Here our decision as to which part is
nearest to us, has reference to the side from which the
light comes. In other cases the decision is more
spontaneous. If we draw black outlines, such as represent
the edges of a cube seen in perspective, certain of the
lines will cross each other; and we may make this cube
appear to assume two different positions, by determining in
our own mind that the lines which belong to one end of the
cube shall be understood to be before or to be behind those
which they cross. Here an act of the will, operating upon
the same sensible image, gives us two cubes, occupying two
entirely different positions. Again, many persons may have
observed that when a windmill in motion at a distance from
us, (so that the outline of the sails only is seen,) stands
obliquely to the eye, we may, by an effort of thought, make
the obliquity assume one or the other of two positions; and
as we do this, the sails, which in one instance appear to
turn from right to left, in the other case turn from left to
right. A person a little familiar with this mental effort,
can invert the motion as often as he pleases, so long as the
conditions of form and light do not offer a manifest
contradiction to either position. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page122">122</a></span>.</p>
<p>Thus we have these abundant and various manifestations of
the activity of the mind, in the process by which we collect
from vision the relations of solid space of three
dimensions. But we must further make some remarks on the
process by which we perceive mere visible figure; and also,
on the mode in which we perceive the relations of space by
the touch; and first, of the latter subject.</p>
<p id="b2c6s7">7. The opinion above illustrated, that our sight does not
give us a direct knowledge of the relations of solid space,
and that this knowledge is acquired only by an inference of
the mind, was first clearly taught by the celebrated Bishop
Berkeley<a id="fnanchor5-2" href="#note5-2"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>, and is a doctrine now generally assented to
by metaphysical speculators.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-2" href="#fnanchor5-2">5</a></span> <i>Theory of Vision.</i></div>
<p>But does the sense of <em>touch</em> give us directly a
knowledge of space? This is a question which has attracted
considerable notice in recent times; and new light has been
thrown upon it in a degree which is very remarkable, when we
consider that the philosophy of perception has been a
prominent subject of inquiry from the earliest times. Two
philosophers, advancing to this inquiry from different
sides, the one a metaphysician, the other a physiologist,
have independently arrived at the conviction that the long
current opinion, according to which we acquire a knowledge
of space by the sense of touch, is erroneous. And the
doctrine which they teach instead of the ancient errour, has
a very important bearing upon the principle which we are
endeavouring to establish,&#8212;that our knowledge of space and
its properties is derived rather from the active operations
than from the passive impressions of the percipient mind.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the persuasion that we acquire a knowledge of
form by the touch is very obviously suggested by our common
habits. If we wish to know the form of any body in the dark,
or to correct the impressions conveyed by sight, when we
suspect them to be false, we have only, it seems to us, at
least at first, to stretch forth the hand and touch the
object; and we learn its <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page123">123</a></span> shape with, no chance of
errour. In these cases, form appears to be as immediate a
perception of the sense of touch, as colour is of the sense
of sight.</p>
<p id="b2c6s8">8. But is this perception really the result of the passive
sense of touch merely? Against such an opinion Dr. Brown,
the metaphysician of whom I speak, urges<a id="fnanchor6-2" href="#note6-2"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a> that the
feeling of touch alone, when any object is applied to the
hand, or any other part of the body, can no more convey the
conception of form or extension, than the sensation of an
odour or a taste can do, except we have already some
knowledge of the relative position of the parts of our
bodies; that is, except we are already in possession of an
idea of space, and have, in our minds, referred our limbs to
their positions; which is to suppose the conception of form
already acquired.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-2" href="#fnanchor6-2">6</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, Vol. i. p. 459, (1824).</div>
<p id="b2c6s9">9. By what faculty then do we originally acquire our
conceptions of the relations of position? Brown answers by
the <em>muscular sense</em>; that is, by the conscious
exertions of the various muscles by which we move our limbs.
When we feel out the form and position of bodies by the
hand, our knowledge is acquired, not by the mere touch of
the body, but by perceiving the course the fingers must take
in order to follow the surface of the body, or to pass from
one body to another. We are conscious of the slightest of
the volitions by which we thus feel out form and place; we
know whether we move the finger to the right or left, up or
down, to us or from us, through a large or a small space;
and all these conscious acts are bound together and
regulated in our minds by an idea of an extended space in
which they are performed. That this idea of space is not
borrowed from the sight, and transferred to the muscular
feelings by habit, is evident. For a man born blind can feel
out his way with his staff, and has his conceptions of
position determined by the conditions of space, no less than
one who has the use of his eyes. And the muscular
consciousness which reveals to us the position of objects
and parts of objects, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page124">124</a></span> when we feel them out by means
of the hand, shows itself in a thousand other ways, and in
all our limbs: for our habits of standing, walking, and all
other attitudes and motions, are regulated by our feeling of
our position and that of surrounding objects. And thus, we
cannot touch any object without learning something
respecting its position; not that the sense of touch
directly conveys such knowledge; but we have already learnt,
from the muscular sense, constantly exercised, the position
of the limb which the object thus touches.</p>
<p id="b2c6s10">10. The justice of this distinction will, I think, be
assented to by all persons who attend steadily to the
process itself, and might be maintained by many forcible
reasons. Perhaps one of the most striking evidences in its
favour is that, as I have already intimated, it is the
opinion to which another distinguished philosopher, Sir
Charles Bell, has been led, reasoning entirely upon
physiological principles. From his researches it resulted
that besides the nerves which convey the impulse of the will
from the brain to the muscle, by which every motion of our
limbs is produced, there is another set of nerves which
carry back to the brain a sense of the condition of the
muscle, and thus regulate its activity; and give us the
consciousness of our position and relation to surrounding
objects. The motion of the hand and fingers, or the
consciousness of this motion, must be combined with the
sense of touch properly so called, in order to make an inlet
to the knowledge of such relations. This consciousness of
muscular exertion, which he has called a sixth sense<a id="fnanchor7-2" href="#note7-2"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>,
is our guide, Sir C. Bell shows, in the common practical
government of our motions; and he states that having given
this explanation of perception as a physiological doctrine,
he had afterwards with satisfaction seen it confirmed by Dr.
Brown’s speculations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-2" href="#fnanchor7-2">7</a></span> <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, p. 195. <i>Phil.
Trans.</i> 1826, Pt. ii. p. 167.</div>
<p id="b2c6s11">11. Thus it appears that our consciousness of the relations
of space is inseparably and fundamentally connected with our
own actions in space. We perceive <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page125">125</a></span> only while we act;
our sensations require to be interpreted by our volitions.
The apprehension of extension and figure is far from being a
process in which we are inert and passive. We draw lines
with our fingers; we construct surfaces by curving our
hands; we generate spaces by the motion of our arms. When
the geometer bids us form lines, or surfaces, or solids by
motion, he intends his injunction to be taken as
hypothetical only; we need only conceive such motions. But
yet this hypothesis represents truly the origin of our
knowledge; we perceive spaces by motion at first, as we
conceive spaces by motion afterwards:&#8212;or if not always by
actual motion, at least by potential. If we perceive the
length of a staff by holding its two ends in our two hands
without running the finger along it, this is because by
habitual motion we have already acquired a measure of the
distance of our hands in any attitude of which we are
conscious. Even in the simplest case, our perceptions are
derived not from the touch, but from the sixth sense; and
this sixth sense at least, whatever may be the case with the
other five, implies an active mind along with the passive
sense.</p>
<p id="b2c6s12">12. Upon attentive consideration, it will be clear that a
large portion of the perceptions respecting space which
appear at first to be obtained by sight alone, are, in fact,
acquired by means of this sixth sense. Thus we consider the
visible sky as a single surface surrounding us and returning
into itself, and thus forming a hemisphere. But such a mode
of conceiving an object of vision could never have occurred
to us, if we had not been able to turn our heads, to follow
this surface, to pursue it till we find it returning into
itself. And when we have done this, we necessarily present
it to ourselves as a concave inclosure within which we are.
The sense of sight alone, without the power of muscular
motion, could not have led us to view the sky as a vault or
hemisphere. Under such circumstances, we should have
perceived only what was presented to the eye in one
position; and if different appearances had been presented in
succession, we could <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page126">126</a></span> not have connected them as parts
of the same picture, for want of any perception of their
relative position. They would have been so many detached and
incoherent visual sensations. The muscular sense connects
their parts into a whole, making them to be only different
portions of one universal scene<a id="fnanchor8-2" href="#note8-2"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-2" href="#fnanchor8-2">8</a></span> It has been objected to this view that we might
obtain a conception of the sky as a hemisphere, by being
ourselves turned round, (as on a music-stool, for instance,)
and thus seeing in succession all parts of the sky. But this
assertion I conceive to be erroneous. By being thus turned
round, we should see a number of pictures which we should
put together as parts of a plane picture; and when we came
round to the original point, we should have no possible
means of deciding that it was the <em>same</em> point: it
would appear only as a <em>repetition</em> of the picture.
That sight, of itself, can give us only a plane picture, the
doctrine of Berkeley, appears to be indisputable; and, no
less so, the doctrine that it is the consciousness of our
own action in space which puts together these pictures so
that they cover the surface of a solid body. We can see
length and breadth with our eyes, but we must thrust out our
arm towards the flat surface, in order that we may, in our
thoughts, combine a third dimension with the other two.</div>
<p id="b2c6s13">13. These considerations point out the fallacy of a very
curious representation made by Dr. Reid, of the convictions
to which man would be led, if he possessed vision without
the sense of touch. To illustrate this subject, Reid uses
the fiction of a nation whom he terms the <i>Idomenians</i>,
who have no sense except that of sight. He describes their
notions of the relations of space as being entirely
different from ours. The axioms of their geometry are quite
contradictory to our axioms. For example, it is held to be
self-evident among them that two straight lines which
intersect each other once, must intersect a second time;
that the three angles of any triangle are <em>greater</em>
than two right angles; and the like. These paradoxes are
obtained by tracing the relations of lines on the surface of
a concave sphere, which surrounds the spectator, and on
which all visible appearances may be supposed to be
presented to him. But from what is said above it appears
that the notion of such a sphere, and such a connexion of
visible objects which are seen in different <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page127">127</a></span>
directions, cannot be arrived at by sight alone. When the
spectator combines in his conception the relations of
long-drawn lines and large figures, as he sees them by
turning his head to the right and to the left, upwards and
downwards, he ceases to be an Idomenian. And thus our
conceptions of the properties of space, derived through the
exercise of one mode of perception, are not at variance with
those obtained in another way; but all such conceptions,
however produced or suggested, are in harmony with each
other; being, as has already been said, only different
aspects of the same idea.</p>
<p id="b2c6s14">14. If our perceptions of the position of objects around us
do not depend on the sense of vision alone, but on the
muscular feeling brought into play when we turn our head, it
will obviously follow that the same is true when we turn the
eye instead of the head. And thus we may learn the form of
objects, not by looking at them with a fixed gaze, but by
following the boundary of them with the eye. While the head
is held perfectly still, the eye can rove along the outlines
of visible objects, scrutinize each point in succession, and
leap from one point to another; each such act being
accompanied by a muscular consciousness which makes us aware
of the direction in which the look is travelling. And we may
thus gather information concerning the figures and places
which we trace out with the visual ray, as the blind man
learns the forms of things which he traces out with his
staff, being conscious of the motions of his hand.</p>
<p id="b2c6s15">15. This view of the mode in which the eye perceives
position, which is thus supported by the analogy of other
members employed for the same purpose, is further confirmed
by Sir Charles Bell by physiological reasons. He teaches us
that<a id="fnanchor9-2" href="#note9-2"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> when an object is seen we employ two senses: there
is an impression on the retina; but we receive also the idea
of position or relation in space, which it is not the office
of the retina to give, by our consciousness of the efforts
of the voluntary <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page128">128</a></span> muscles of the eye: and he has traced
in detail the course of the nerves by which these muscles
convey their information. The constant <i>searching</i> motion of
the eye, as he terms it<a id="fnanchor10-2" href="#note10-2"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>, is the means by which we
become aware of the position of objects about us.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-2" href="#fnanchor9-2">9</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1823. On the Motions of the

adopted, in writing the above, the views and expressions of
Sir Charles Bell. The essential part of the doctrine there
presented is, that the eye constantly makes efforts to turn,
so that the image of an object to which our attention is
drawn, shall fall upon a certain particular point of the
retina; and that when the image falls upon any other point,
the eye turns away from this oblique into the direct
position. Other writers have maintained that the eye thus
turns not because the point on which the image falls in
direct vision is the most <em>sensible</em> point, but that
it is the point of <em>greatest distinctness</em> of vision.
They urge that a small star, which disappears when the eye
is turned full upon it, may often be seen by looking a
little away from it: and hence, they infer that the parts of
the retina removed from the spot of direct vision, are more
sensible than it is. The facts are very curious, however
they be explained, but they do not disturb the doctrine
delivered in the text.</div>
<p id="b2c6s16">16. It is not to our present purpose to follow the
physiology of this subject; but we may notice that Sir C.
Bell has examined the special circumstances which belong to
this operation of the eye. We learn from him that the
particular point of the eye which thus traces the forms of
visible objects is a part of the retina which has been
termed the <i>sensible spot</i>; being that part which is
<em>most distinctly</em> sensible to the impressions of
light and colour. This part, indeed, is not a spot of
definite size and form, for it appears that proceeding from
a certain point of the retina, the distinct sensibility
diminishes on every side by degrees. And the searching
motion of the eye arises from the desire which we
instinctively feel of receiving upon the sensible spot the
image of the object to which the attention is directed. We
are uneasy and impatient till the eye is turned so that this
is effected. And as our attention is transferred from point
to point of the scene before us, the eye, and this point of
the eye in particular, travel along with the thoughts; and
the muscular sense, which tells us of these movements of the
organ of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page129">129</a></span> vision, conveys to us a knowledge of the
forms and places which we thus successively survey.</p>
<p id="b2c6s17">17. How much of activity there is in the process by which we
perceive the outlines of objects appears further from the
language by which we describe their forms. We apply to them
not merely adjectives of form, but verbs of motion. An
abrupt hill <em>starts</em> out of the plain; a beautiful
figure has a <em>gliding</em> outline. We have</p>

</div></div>
<p class="noind">These terms express the course of the eye as it follows the
lines by which such forms are bounded and marked. In like
manner another modern poet<a id="fnanchor11-2" href="#note11-2"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> says of Soracte, that it</p>

<p>Thus the muscular sense, which is inseparably connected with
an act originating in our own mind, not only gives us all
that portion of our perceptions of space in which we use the
sense of touch, but also, at least in a great measure,
another large portion of such perceptions, in which we
employ the sense of sight. As we have before seen that our
<em>knowledge</em> of solid space and its properties is not
conceivable in any other way than as the result of a mental
act, governed by conditions depending on its own nature; so
it now appears that our <em>perceptions</em> of visible
figure are not obtained without an act performed under the
same conditions. The sensations of touch and sight are
subordinated to an idea which is the basis of our
speculative knowledge concerning space and its relations;
and this same idea is disclosed to our consciousness by its
practically regulating our intercourse with the external
world.</p>
<p>By considerations such as have been adduced and referred to,
it is proved beyond doubt, that in a great <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page130">130</a></span> number of
cases our knowledge of form and position is acquired from
the muscular sense, and not from sight directly:&#8212;for
instance, in all cases in which we have before us objects so
large and prospects so extensive that we cannot see the
whole of them in one position of the eye<a id="fnanchor12-2" href="#note12-2"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-2" href="#fnanchor12-2">12</a></span> The expression in the first edition was ‘large
objects and extensive spaces.’ In the text as now given, I
state a definite size and extent, within which the sight by
itself can judge of position and figure.<br/>
&#8195;The doctrine, that we require the assistance of the muscular
sense to enable us to perceive space of three dimensions, is
not at all inconsistent with this other doctrine, that
within the space which is seen by the fixed eye, we perceive
the relative positions of points directly by vision, and
that, consequently, we have a perception of <i>visible
figure</i>.<br/>
&#8195;Sir Charles Bell has said, (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1823, p.
181,) ‘It appears to me that the utmost ingenuity will be at
a loss to devise an explanation of that power by which the
eye becomes acquainted with the position and relation of
objects, if the sense of muscular activity be excluded which
accompanies the motion of the eyeball.’ But surely we should
have no difficulty in perceiving the relation of the sides
and angles of a small triangle, placed before the eye, even
if the muscles of the eyeball were severed. This subject is
resumed b. iv. c. ii. <a href="#b4c2s11">sect. 11</a>.</div>
<p>We now quit the consideration of the properties of Space,
and consider the Idea of Time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Idea of Time.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b2c7s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> R</span>ESPECTING the Idea of Time, we may make several of the
same remarks which we made concerning the idea of space, in
order to show that it is not borrowed from experience, but
is a bond of connexion among the impressions of sense,
derived from a peculiar activity of the mind, and forming a
foundation both of our experience and of our speculative
knowledge.</p>
<p>Time is not a notion obtained by experience. Experience,
that is, the impressions of sense and our consciousness of
our thoughts, gives us various perceptions; and different
successive perceptions considered together exemplify the
notion of change. But this very connexion of different
perceptions,&#8212;this successiveness,&#8212;presupposes that the
perceptions exist <em>in time</em>. That things happen
either together, or one after the other, is intelligible
only by assuming time as the condition under which they are
presented to us.</p>
<p>Thus time is a necessary condition in the presentation of
all occurrences to our minds. We cannot conceive this
condition to be taken away. We can conceive time to go on
while nothing happens in it; but we cannot conceive anything
to happen while time does not go on.</p>
<p>It is clear from this that time is not an impression derived
from experience, in the same manner in which we derive from
experience our information concerning the objects which
exist, and the occurrences which take place in time. The
objects of experience can easily be conceived to be, or not
to be:&#8212;to be absent as well as present. Time always is, and
always is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page132">132</a></span> present, and even in our thoughts we cannot
form the contrary supposition.</p>
<p id="b2c7s2">2. Thus time is something distinct from the <em>matter</em>
or substance of our experience, and may be considered as a
necessary <em>form</em> which that matter (the experience of
change) must assume, in order to be an object of
contemplation to the mind. Time is one of the necessary
conditions under which we apprehend the information which
our senses and consciousness give us. By considering time as
a form which belongs to our power of apprehending
occurrences and changes, and under which alone all such
experience can be accepted by the mind, we explain the
necessity, which we find to exist, of conceiving all such
changes as happening in time; and we thus see that time is
not a property perceived as existing in objects, or as
conveyed to us by our senses; but a condition impressed upon
our knowledge by the constitution of the mind itself;
involving an act of thought as well as an impression of
sense.</p>
<p id="b2c7s3">3. We showed that space is an idea of the mind, or form of
our perceiving power, independent of experience, by pointing
out that we possess necessary and universal truths
concerning the relations of space, which could never be
given by means of experience; but of which the necessity is
readily conceivable, if we suppose them to have for their
basis the constitution of the mind. There exist also
respecting number, many truths absolutely necessary,
entirely independent of experience and anterior to it; and
so far as the conception of number depends upon the idea of
time, the same argument might be used to show that the idea
of time is not derived from experience, but is a result of
the native activity of the mind: but we shall defer all
views of this kind till we come to the consideration of
Number.</p>
<p id="b2c7s4">4. Some persons have supposed that we obtain the notion of
time from the perception of motion. But it is clear that the
perception of motion, that is, change of place, presupposes
the conception of time, and is not capable of being
presented to the mind in any other <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page133">133</a></span> way. If we
contemplate the same body as being in different places at
different times, and connect these observations, we have the
conception of motion, which thus presupposes the necessary
conditions that existence in time implies. And thus we see
that it is possible there should be necessary truths
concerning all Motion, and consequently, concerning those
motions which are the objects of experience; but that the
source of this necessity is the Ideas of Time and Space,
which, being universal conditions of knowledge residing in
the mind, afford a foundation for necessary truths.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of some Peculiarities of the Idea of Time.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b2c8s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
Idea of Time, like the Idea of Space, offers to our
notice some characters which do not belong to our
fundamental ideas generally, but which are deserving of
remark. These characters are, in some respects, closely
similar with regard to Time and to Space, while, in other
respects, the peculiarities of these two ideas are widely
different. We shall point out some of these characters.</p>
<p>Time is not a general <em>abstract</em> notion collected
from experience; as, for example, a certain general
conception of the relations of things. For we do not
consider particular <em>times</em> as examples of Time in
general, (as we consider particular causes to be examples of
Cause,) but we conceive all particular times to be parts of
a single and endless Time. This continually-flowing and
endless time is what offers itself to us when we contemplate
any series of occurrences. All actual and possible times
exist as Parts, in this original and general Time. And since
all particular times are considered as derivable from time
in general, it is manifest that the notion of time in
general cannot be derived from the notions of particular
times. The notion of time in general is therefore not a
general conception gathered from experience.</p>
<p id="b2c8s2">2. Time is infinite. Since all actual and possible times
exist in the general course of time, this general time must
be infinite. All limitation merely divides, and does not
terminate, the extent of absolute time. Time has no
beginning and no end; but the beginning and the end of every
other existence takes place in it.</p>
<p id="b2c8s3">3. Time, like space, is not only a form of perception, but
of <em>intuition</em>. We contemplate events as <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page135">135</a></span> taking
place <em>in</em> time. We consider its parts as added to
one another, and events as filling a larger or smaller
extent of such parts. The time which any event takes up is
the sum of all such parts, and the relation of the same to
time is fully understood when we can clearly see what
portions of time it occupies, and what it does not. Thus the
relation of known occurrences to time is perceived by
intuition; and time is a form of intuition of the external
world.</p>
<p id="b2c8s4">4. Time is conceived as a quantity of one dimension; it has
great analogy with a line, but none at all with a surface or
solid. Time may be considered as consisting of a series of
instants, which are before and after one another; and they
have no other relation than this, of <i>before</i> and
<i>after</i>. Just the same would be the case with a series
of points taken along a line; each would be after those on
one side of it, and before those on another. Indeed the
analogy between time, and space of one dimension, is so
close, that the same terms are applied to both ideas, and we
hardly know to which they originally belong. Times and lines
are alike called <i>long</i> and <i>short</i>; we speak of
the <i>beginning</i> and <i>end</i> of a line; of a
<i>point</i> of time, and of the <i>limits</i> of a portion
of duration.</p>
<p id="b2c8s5">5. But, as has been said, there is nothing in time which
corresponds to more than one dimension in space, and hence
nothing which has any obvious analogy with figure. Time
resembles a line indefinitely extended both ways; all
partial times are portions of this line; and no mode of
conceiving time suggests to us a line making any angle with
the original line, or any other combination which might give
rise to figures of any kind. The analogy between time and
space, which in many circumstances is so clear, here
disappears altogether. Spaces of two and of three
dimensions, planes and solids, have nothing to which we can
compare them in the conceptions arising out of time.</p>
<p id="b2c8s6">6. As figure is a conception solely appropriate to space,
there is also a conception which peculiarly belongs to time,
namely, the conception of recurrence of times similarly
marked; or, as it may be termed, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page136">136</a></span> <i>rhythm</i>, using
this word in a general sense. The term rhythm is most
commonly used to designate the recurrence of times marked by
the syllables of a verse, or the notes of a melody: but it
is easy to see that the general conception of such a
recurrence does not depend on the mode in which it is
impressed upon the sense. The forms of such recurrence are
innumerable. Thus in such a line as</p>
  <p class="center medium">Quádrupedánte putrém sonitú quatit úngula cámpum,</p>
<p class="noind">we have alternately one long or forcible syllable, and two
short or light ones, recurring over and over. In like manner
in our own language, in the line</p>
  <p class="center medium">
  At the clóse of the dáy when the hámlet is still,</p>
<p class="noind">we have two light and one strong syllable repeated four times
over. Such repetition is the essence of versification. The
same kind of rhythm is one of the main elements of music,
with this difference only, that in music the forcible
syllables are made so for the purposes of rhythm by their
length only or principally; for example, if either of the
above lines were imitated by a melody in the most simple and
obvious manner, each strong syllable would occupy exactly
twice as much time as two of the weaker ones. Something very
analogous to such rhythm may be traced in other parts of
poetry and art, which we need not here dwell upon. But in
reference to our present subject, we may remark that by the
introduction of such rhythm, the flow of time, which appears
otherwise so perfectly simple and homogeneous, admits of an
infinite number of varied yet regular modes of progress. All
the kinds of versification which occur in all languages, and
the still more varied forms of recurrence of notes of
different lengths, which are heard in all the varied strains
of melodies, are only examples of such modifications, or
configurations as we may call them, of time. They involve
relations of various portions of time, as figures involve
relations of various portions of space. But yet the analogy
between rhythm and figure is by no means very close; for in
rhythm we have relations of quantity alone in the parts of
time, whereas in figure we have <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page137">137</a></span> relations not only of
quantity, but of a kind altogether different,&#8212;namely, of
position. On the other hand, a <em>repetition</em> of similar
elements, which does not necessarily occur in figures, is
quite essential in order to impress upon us that measured
progress of time of which we here speak. And thus the ideas
of time and space have each its peculiar and exclusive
relations; position and figure belonging only to space,
while repetition and rhythm are appropriate to time.</p>
<p id="b2c8s7">7. One of the simplest forms of recurrence is
<i>alternation</i>, as when we have alternate strong and
slight syllables. For instance,&#8212;</p>
  <p class="center medium">Awáke, aríse, or bé for éver fáll’n.</p>
<p class="noind">Or without any subordination, as when we reckon numbers,
and call them in succession, <i>odd</i>, <i>even</i>, <i>odd</i>, <i>even</i>.</p>
<p id="b2c8s8">8. But the simplest of all forms of recurrence is that which
has no variety;&#8212;in which a series of units, each considered
as exactly similar to the rest, succeed each other; as
<i>one</i>, <i>one</i>, <i>one</i>, and so on. In this case,
however, we are led to consider each unit with reference to
all that have preceded; and thus the series  <i>one</i>,
<i>one</i>, <i>one</i>, and so forth, becomes <i>one</i>,
<i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, <i>four</i>, <i>five</i>, and so
on; a series with which all are familiar, and which may be
continued without limit.</p>
<p>We thus collect from that repetition of which time admits,
the conception of <i>Number</i>.</p>
<p>9. The relations of position and figure are the subject of
the science of geometry; and are, as we have already said,
traced into a very remarkable and extensive body of truths,
which rests for its foundations on axioms involved in the
Idea of Space. There is, in like manner, a science of great
complexity and extent, which has its foundation in the Idea
of Time. But this science, as it is usually pursued, applies
only to the conception of Number, which is, as we have said,
the simplest result of repetition. This science is
<i>Theoretical Arithmetic</i>, or the speculative doctrine
of the properties and relations of numbers; and we must say
a few words concerning the principles which it is requisite
to assume as the basis of this science.</p>
<div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Axioms which relate to Number.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b2c9s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
foundations of our speculative knowledge of the
relations and properties of Number, as well as of Space, are
contained in the mode in which we represent to ourselves the
magnitudes which are the subjects of our reasonings. To
express these foundations in axioms in the case of number,
is a matter requiring some consideration, for the same
reason as in the case of geometry; that is, because these
axioms are principles which we assume as true, without being
aware that we have made any assumption; and we cannot,
without careful scrutiny, determine when we have stated, in
the form of axioms, all that is necessary for the formation
of the science, and no more than is necessary. We will,
however, attempt to detect the principles which really must
form the basis of theoretical arithmetic.</p>
<p id="b2c9s2">2. Why is it that three and two are equal to four and one?
Because if we look at five things of any kind, we see that
it is so. The five are four and one; they are also three and
two. The truth of our assertion is involved in our being
able to conceive the number five at all. We perceive this
truth by <em>intuition</em>, for we cannot see, or imagine we see,
five things, without perceiving also that the assertion
above stated is true.</p>
<p>But how do we state in words this fundamental principle of
the doctrine of numbers? Let us consider a very simple case.
If we wish to show that seven and two are equal to four and
five, we say that seven are four and three, <em>therefore</em> seven
and two are four and three and two; and because three and
two are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page139">139</a></span> five, this is four and five. Mathematical
reasoners justify the first inference (marked by the
conjunctive word <i>therefore</i>), by saying that “When
equals are added to equals the wholes are equal,” and that
thus, since seven is equal to three and four, if we add two
to both, seven and two are equal to four and three and two.</p>
<p id="b2c9s3">3. Such <i>axioms</i> as this, that when equals are added to
equals the wholes are equal, are, in fact, expressions of
the general condition of intuition, by which a whole is
contemplated as made up of parts, and as identical with the
aggregate of the parts. And a yet more general form in which
we might more adequately express this condition of intuition
would be this; that ‘Two magnitudes are equal when they can
be divided into parts which are equal, each to each.’ Thus
in the above example, seven and two are equal to four and
five, because each of the two sums can be divided into the
parts, four, three, and two.</p>
<p id="b2c9s4">4. In all these cases, a person who had never seen such
axioms enunciated in a verbal form would employ the same
reasoning as a practised mathematician, in order to satisfy
himself that the proposition was true. The steps of the
reasoning, being seen to be true by intuition, would carry
an entire conviction, whether or not the argument were made
verbally complete. Hence the axioms may appear superfluous,
and on this account such axioms have often been spoken
contemptuously of, as empty and barren assertions. In fact,
however, although they cannot supply the deficiency of the
clear intuition of number and space in the reasoner himself,
and although when he possesses such a faculty, he will
reason rightly if he have never heard of such axioms, they
still have their place properly at the beginning of our
treatises on the science of quantity; since they express, as
simply as words can express, those conditions of the
intuition of magnitudes on which all reasoning concerning
quantity must be based; and are necessary when we want, not
only to see the truth of the elementary reasonings on these
subjects, but to put such reasonings in a formal and logical
shape. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page140">140</a></span></p>
<p id="b2c9s5">5. We have considered the above-mentioned axioms as the
basis of all arithmetical operations of the nature of
<i>addition</i>. But it is easily seen that the same
principle may be carried into other cases; as for instance,
<i>multiplication</i>, which is merely a repeated addition,
and admits of the same kind of evidence. Thus five times
three are equal to three times five; why is this? If we
arrange fifteen things in five rows of three, it is seen by
looking, or by imaginary looking, which is <i>intuition</i>,
that they may also be taken as three rows of five. And thus
the principle that those wholes are equal which can be
resolved into the same partial magnitudes, is immediately
applicable in this as in the other case.</p>
<p id="b2c9s6">6. We may proceed to higher numbers, and may find ourselves
obliged to use artificial nomenclature and notation in order
to represent and reckon them; but the reasoning in these
cases also is still the same. And the usual artifice by
which our reasoning in such instances is assisted is, that
the number which is the root of our scale of notation (which
is <i>ten</i> in our usual system), is alternately separated
into parts and treated as a single thing. Thus 47 and 35 are
82; for 47 is four tens and seven; 35 is three tens and
five; whence 47 and 35 are seven tens and twelve; that is, 7
tens, 1 ten, and 2; which is 8 tens and 2, or 82. The like
reasoning is applicable in other cases. And since the most
remote and complex properties of numbers are obtained by a
prolongation of a course of reasoning exactly similar to
that by which we thus establish the most elementary
propositions, we have, in the principles just noticed, the
foundation of the whole of Theoretical Arithmetic.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Perception of Time and Number.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b2c10s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> O</span>UR
perception of the passage of time involves a series
of acts of memory. This is easily seen and assented to, when
large intervals of time and a complex train of occurrences
are concerned. But since memory is requisite in order to
apprehend time in such cases, we cannot doubt that the same
faculty must be concerned in the shortest and simplest cases
of succession; for it will hardly be maintained that the
process by which we contemplate the progress of time is
different, when small, and when large intervals are
concerned. If memory be absolutely requisite to connect two
events which begin and end a day, and to perceive a tract of
time between them, it must be equally indispensable to
connect the beginning and end of a minute, or a second;
though in this case the effort may be smaller, and
consequently more easily overlooked. In common cases, we are
unconscious of the act of thought by which we recollect the
preceding instant, though we perceive the effort when we
recollect some distant event. And this is analogous to what
happens in other instances. Thus, we walk without being
conscious of the volitions by which we move our muscles;
but, in order to leap, a distinct and manifest exertion of
the same muscles is necessary. Yet no one will doubt that we
walk as well as leap by an act of the will exerted through
the muscles; and in like manner, our consciousness of small
as well as large intervals of time involves something of the
nature of an act of memory.</p>
<p id="b2c10s2">2. But this constant and almost imperceptible kind of
memory, by which we connect the beginning and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page142">142</a></span> end of
each instant as it passes, may very fitly be distinguished
in common cases from manifest acts of recollection, although
it may be difficult or impossible to separate the two
operations in general. This perpetual and latent kind of
memory may be termed a <i>sense of successiveness</i>; and
must be considered as an internal sense by which we perceive
ourselves existing in time, much in the same way as by our
external and muscular sense we perceive ourselves existing
in space. And both our internal thoughts and feelings, and
the events which take place around us, are apprehended as
objects of this internal sense, and thus as taking place in
time.</p>
<p id="b2c10s3">3. In the same manner in which our interpretation of the
notices of the muscular sense implies the power of moving
our limbs, and of touching at will this object or that; our
apprehension of the relations of time, by means of the
internal sense of successiveness, implies a power of
recalling what has past, and of retaining what is passing.
We are able to seize the occurrences which have just taken
place, and to hold them fast in our minds so as mentally to
measure their distance in time from occurrences now present.
And thus, this sense of successiveness, like the muscular
sense with which we have compared it, implies activity of
the mind itself, and is not a sense passively receiving
impressions.</p>
<p id="b2c10s4">4. The conception of <i>Number</i> appears to require the
exercise of the same sense of succession. At first sight,
indeed, we seem to apprehend Number without any act of
memory, or any reference to time: for example, we look at a
horse, and see that his legs are four; and this we seem to
do at once, without reckoning them. But it is not difficult
to see that this seeming instantaneousness of the perception
of small numbers is an illusion. This resembles the many
other cases in which we perform short and easy acts so
rapidly and familiarly that we are unconscious of them; as
in the acts of seeing, and of articulating our words. And
this is the more manifest, since we begin our acquaintance
with number by counting even the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page143">143</a></span> smallest numbers.
Children and very rude savages must use an effort to reckon
even their five fingers, and find a difficulty in going
further. And persons have been known who were able by habit,
or by a peculiar natural aptitude, to count by dozens as
rapidly as common persons can by units. We may conclude,
therefore, that when we appear to catch a small number by a
single glance of the eye, we do in fact count the units of
it in a regular, though very brief succession. To count
requires an act of memory. Of this we are sensible when we
count very slowly, as when we reckon the strokes of a
church-clock; for in such a case we may forget in the
intervals of the strokes, and <i>miscount</i>. Now it will
not be doubted that the nature of the process in counting is
the same whether we count fast or slow. There is no definite
speed of reckoning at which the faculties which it requires
are changed; and therefore memory, which is requisite in
some cases, must be so in all<a id="fnanchor13-2" href="#note13-2"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-2" href="#fnanchor13-2">13</a></span> I have considered Number as involving the
exercise of the sense of succession, because I cannot draw
any line between those cases of large numbers, in which, the
process of counting being performed, there is a manifest
apprehension of succession; and those cases of small
numbers, in which we seem to see the number at one glance.
But if any one holds  Number to be apprehended by a direct
act of intuition, as Space and Time are, this view will not
disturb the other doctrines delivered in the text.</div>
<p>The act of counting, (<i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>,
and so on,) is the foundation of all our knowledge of
number. The intuition of the relations of number involves
this act of counting; for, as we have just seen, the
conception of number cannot be obtained in any other way.
And thus the whole of theoretical arithmetic depends upon an
act of the mind, and upon the conditions which the exercise
of that act implies. These have been already explained in
the last chapter.</p>
<p id="b2c10s5">5. But if the apprehension of number be accompanied by an
act of the mind, the apprehension of <i>rhythm</i> is so
still more clearly. All the forms of versification and the
<i>measures</i> of melodies are the creations of man, who
thus realizes in words and sounds the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page144">144</a></span> forms of
recurrence which rise within his own mind. When we hear in a
quiet scene any rapidly-repeated sound, as those made by the
hammer of the smith or the saw of the carpenter, every one
knows how insensibly we throw these noises into a rhythmical
form in our own apprehension. We do this even without any
suggestion from the sounds themselves. For instance, if the
beats of a clock or watch be ever so exactly alike, we still
reckon them alternately tick-<i>tack</i>, tick-<i>tack</i>.
That this is the case, may be proved by taking a watch or
clock of such a construction that the returning swing of the
pendulum is silent, and in which therefore all the beats are
rigorously alike: we shall find ourselves still reckoning
its sounds as tick-<i>tack</i>. In this instance it is
manifest that the rhythm is entirely of our own making. In
melodies, also, and in verses in which the rhythm is
complex, obscure and difficult, we perceive something is
required on our part; for we are often incapable of
contributing our share, and thus lose the sense of the
measure altogether. And when we consider such cases, and
attend to what passes within us when we catch the measure,
even of the simplest and best-known air, we shall no longer
doubt that an act of our own thoughts is requisite in such
cases, as well as impressions on the sense. And thus the
conception of this peculiar modification of time, which we
have called <i>rhythm</i>, like all the other views which we
have taken of the subject, shows that we must, in order to
form such conceptions, supply a certain idea by our own
thoughts, as well as merely receive by senses, whether
external or internal, the impressions of appearances and
collections of appearances.</p>

<h4>NOTE TO CHAPTER X.</h4>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I have</span> in the last ten chapters described Space, Time, and
Number by various expressions, all intended to point out
their office as exemplifying the Ideal Element of human
knowledge. I have called them <i>Fundamental Ideas</i>;
<i>Forms of Perception</i>; <i>Forms of Intuition</i>; and
perhaps other names. I might add yet other phrases. I might
say that the properties of Space, Time, and Number are
<i>Laws of the Mind’s Activity</i> in apprehending what is.
For the mind cannot apprehend any thing or event except
conformably to the properties of space, time, and number. It
is not only that it <em>does</em> not, but it <em>can</em> not: and this
impossibility shows that the law is a law of the mind, and
not of objects extraneous to the mind.</p>
<p>It is usual for some of those who reject the doctrines here
presented to say that the axioms of geometry, and of other
sciences, are obtained by Induction from facts constantly
presented by experience. But I do not see how Induction can
prove that a proposition <em>must</em> be true. The only
intelligible usage of the word <i>Induction</i> appears to
me to be, that in which it is applied to a proposition
which, being separable from the facts in our apprehension,
and being compared with them, is seen to agree with them.
But in the cases now spoken of, the proposition is not
separable from the facts. We cannot infer by induction that
two straight lines cannot inclose a space, because we cannot
contemplate special cases of two lines inclosing a space, in
which it remains to be determined whether or not the
proposition, that both are straight, is true.</p>
<p>I do not deny that the activity of the mind by which it
perceives objects and events as related according to the
laws of space, time, and number, is awakened and developed
by being constantly exercised; and that we cannot imagine a
stage of human existence in which the powers have not been
awakened and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page146">146</a></span> developed by such exercise. In this way,
experience and observation are necessary conditions and
prerequisites of our apprehension of geometrical (and other)
axioms. We cannot see the truth of these axioms without some
experience, because we cannot see any thing, or be human
beings, without some experience. This might be expressed by
saying that such truths are acquired necessarily <i>in the
course of</i> all experience; but I think it is very
undesirable to apply, to such a case, the word
<i>Induction</i>, of which it is so important to us to keep
the scientific meaning free from confusion. Induction cannot
give demonstrative proofs, as I have already stated in Book
1. C. i. <a href="#b1c1s3">sect. 3</a>, and therefore cannot be the ground of
necessary truths.</p>
<p>Another expression which may be used to describe the
Fundamental Ideas here spoken of is suggested by the
language of a very profound and acute Review of the former
edition. The Reviewer holds that we pass from special
experiences to universal truths in virtue of ‘the inductive
propensity&#8212;the irresistible impulse of the mind to
generalize <i>ad infinitum</i>.’ I have already given
reasons why I cannot adopt the former expression; but I do
not see why space, time, number, cause, and the rest, may
not be termed <i>different forms</i> of the <i>impulse of
the mind to generalize</i>. But if we put together all the
Fundamental Ideas as results of the Generalizing Impulse, we
must still separate them as different modes of action of
that Impulse, showing themselves in various characteristic
ways in the axioms and modes of reasoning which belong to
different sciences. The Generalizing Impulse in one case
proceeds according to the Idea of Space; in another,
according to the Idea of Mechanical Cause; and so in other
subjects.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of Mathematical Reasoning.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b2c11s1">1. <i>Discursive Reasoning.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">We</span> have thus seen that our
notions of space, time, and their modifications, necessarily
involve a certain activity of the mind; and that the
conditions of this activity form the foundations of those
sciences which have the relations of space, time, and
number, for their object. Upon the fundamental principles
thus established, the various sciences which are included in
the term <i>Pure Mathematics</i>, (Geometry, Algebra,
Trigonometry, Conic Sections, and the rest of the Higher
Geometry, the Differential Calculus, and the like,) are
built up by a series of reasonings. These reasonings are
subject to the rules of Logic, as we have already remarked;
nor is it necessary here to dwell long on the nature and
rules of such processes. But we may here notice that such
processes are termed <i>discursive</i>, in opposition to the
operations by which we acquire our fundamental principles,
which are, as we have seen, <i>intuitive</i>. This
opposition was formerly very familiar to our writers; as
Milton,&#8212;</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i1"> .&#8195; .&#8195; .&#8195; Thus the soul reason receives,</span><br/>
    <span class="i0">Discursive or intuitive.&#8212;<i>Paradise Lost</i>, v. 438.</span><br/>
    </div>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">For in such reasonings we obtain our conclusions, not by looking
at our conceptions steadily in one view, which is <i>intuition</i>,
but by passing from one view to another, like those who run
from place to place (<i>discursus</i>). Thus a straight line
may be at the same time a side of a triangle and a radius of
a circle: and in the first proposition of Euclid a line is
considered, first in one of these relations, and then in the
other, and thus the sides of a certain triangle are proved
to be equal. And by this ‘discourse of reason,’ as by our
older <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page148">148</a></span> writers it was termed, we set forth from those
axioms which we perceive by intuition, travel securely over
a vast and varied region, and become possessed of a copious
store of mathematical truths.</p>
<p id="b2c11s2">2. <i>Technical Terms of Reasoning.</i>&#8212;The reasoning of
mathematics, thus proceeding from a few simple principles to
many truths, is conducted according to the rules of Logic.
If it be necessary, mathematical proofs may be reduced to
logical forms, and expressed in Syllogisms, consisting of
major, minor, and conclusion. But in most cases the
syllogism is of that kind which is called by logical writers
an <i>Enthymeme</i>; a word which implies something existing
in the thoughts only, and which designates a syllogism in
which one of the premises is understood, and not expressed.
Thus we say in a mathematical proof, ‘because the point <span class="sc">c</span> is
the center of the circle <span class="sc">ab, ac</span> is equal to <span class="sc">bc</span>;’ not stating
the <i>major</i>,&#8212;that all lines drawn from the center of a
circle to the circumference are equal; or introducing it
only by a transient reference to the definition of a circle.
But the enthymeme is so constantly used in all habitual
forms of reasoning, that it does not occur to us as being
anything peculiar in mathematical works.</p>
<p>The propositions which are proved to be generally true are
termed <i>Theorems</i>: but when anything is required to be
done, as to draw a line or a circle under given conditions,
this proposition is a <i>Problem</i>. A theorem requires
demonstration; a problem, solution. And for both purposes
the mathematician usually makes a <i>Construction</i>. He
directs us to draw certain lines, circles, or other curves,
on which is to be founded his demonstration that his theorem
is true, or that his problem is solved. Sometimes, too, he
establishes some <i>Lemma</i>, or preparatory proposition,
before he proceeds to his main task; and often he deduces
from his demonstration some conclusion in addition to that
which was the professed object of his proposition; and this
is termed a <i>Corollary</i>.</p>
<p>These technical terms are noted here, not as being very
important, but in order that they may not sound <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page149">149</a></span>
strange and unintelligible if we should have occasion to use
some of them. There is, however, one technical distinction
more peculiar, and more important.</p>
<p id="b2c11s3">3. <i>Geometrical Analysis and Synthesis.</i>&#8212;In
geometrical reasoning such as we have described, we
introduce at every step some new consideration; and it is by
combining all these considerations, that we arrive at the
conclusion, that is, the demonstration of the proposition.
Each step tends to the final result, by exhibiting some part
of the figure under a new relation. To what we have already
proved, is added something more; and hence this process is
called <i>Synthesis</i>, or <i>putting together</i>. The
proof flows on, receiving at every turn new contributions
from different quarters; like a river fed and augmented by
many tributary streams. And each of these tributaries flows
from some definition or axiom as its fountain, or is itself
formed by the union of smaller rivulets which have sources
of this kind. In descending along its course, the
synthetical proof gathers all these accessions into one
common trunk, the proposition finally proved.</p>
<p>But we may proceed in a different manner. We may begin from
the formed river, and ascend to its sources. We may take the
proposition of which we require a proof, and may examine
what the supposition of its truth implies. If this be true,
then something else may be seen to be true; and from this,
something else, and so on. We may often, in this way,
discover of what simpler propositions our theorem or
solution is compounded, and may resolve these in succession,
till we come to some proposition which is obvious. This is
geometrical <i>Analysis</i>. Having succeeded in this
analytical process, we may invert it; and may descend again
from the simple and known propositions, to the proof of a
theorem, or the solution of a problem, which was our
starting-place.</p>
<p>This process resembles, as we have said, tracing a river to
its sources. As we ascend the stream, we perpetually meet
with bifurcations; and some sagacity is needed to enable us
to see which, in each case, is the main stream: but if we
proceed in our research, we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page150">150</a></span> exhaust the unexplored
valleys, and finally obtain a clear knowledge of the place
whence the waters flow. <i>Analytical</i> is sometimes
confounded with <i>symbolical</i> reasoning, on which
subject we shall make a remark in the next chapter. The
object of that chapter is to notice certain other
fundamental principles and ideas, not included in those
hitherto spoken of, which we find thrown in our way as we
proceed in our mathematical speculations. It would detain us
too long, and involve us in subtle and technical
disquisitions, to examine fully the grounds of these
principles; but the Mathematics hold so important a place in
relation to the inductive sciences, that I shall briefly
notice the leading ideas which the ulterior progress of the
subject involves.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page151"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Foundations of the Higher Mathematics.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b2c12s1">1. <i>The Idea of a Limit.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">The</span> general truths
concerning relations of space which depend upon the axioms
and definitions contained in Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>, and
which involve only properties of straight lines and circles,
are termed Elementary Geometry: all beyond this belongs to
the Higher Geometry. To this latter province appertain, for
example, all propositions respecting the lengths of any
portions of curve lines; for these cannot be obtained by
means of the principles of the Elements alone. Here then we
must ask to what other principles the geometer has recourse,
and from what source these are drawn. Is there any origin of
geometrical truth which we have not yet explored?</p>
<p>The <i>Idea of a Limit</i> supplies a new mode of
establishing mathematical truths. Thus with regard to the
length of any portion of a curve, a problem which we have
just mentioned; a curve is not made up of straight lines,
and therefore we cannot by means of any of the doctrines of
elementary geometry measure the length of any curve. But we
may make up a figure nearly resembling any curve by putting
together many short straight lines, just as a polygonal
building of very many sides may nearly resemble a circular
room. And in order to approach nearer and nearer to the
curve, we may make the sides more and more small, more and
more numerous. We may then possibly find some mode of
measurement, some relation of these small lines to other
lines, which is not disturbed by the multiplication of the
sides, however far it be carried. And thus, we may do what
is equivalent to measuring the curve itself; for by
multiplying the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page152">152</a></span> sides we may approach more and more
closely to the curve till no appreciable difference remains.
The curve line is the <i>Limit</i> of the polygon; and in
this process we proceed on the <i>Axiom</i>, that ‘What is
true up to the Limit is true at the Limit.’</p>
<p>This mode of conceiving mathematical magnitudes is of wide
extent and use; for every curve may be considered as the
limit of some polygon; every varied magnitude, as the limit
of some aggregate of simpler forms; and thus the relations
of the elementary figures enable us to advance to the
properties of the most complex cases.</p>
<p>A Limit is a peculiar and fundamental conception, the use of
which in proving the propositions of the Higher Geometry
cannot be superseded by any combination of other hypotheses
and definitions<a id="fnanchor14-2" href="#note14-2"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>. The axiom just noticed, that what is
true up to the limit is true at the limit, is involved in
the very conception of a Limit: and this principle, with its
consequences, leads to all the results which form the
subject of the higher mathematics, whether proved by the
consideration of evanescent triangles, by the processes of
the Differential Calculus, or in any other way.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-2" href="#fnanchor14-2">14</a></span> This assertion cannot be fully proved and
illustrated without a reference to mathematical reasonings
which would not be generally intelligible. I have shown the
truth of the assertion in my <i>Thoughts on the Study of
Mathematics</i>, annexed to the <i>Principles of English
University Education</i>. The proof is of this kind:&#8212;The
ultimate equality of an arc of a curve and the corresponding
periphery of a polygon, when the sides of the polygon are
indefinitely increased in number, is <i>evident</i>. But
this truth cannot be proved from any other axiom. For if we
take the supposed axiom, that a curve is always less than
the including broken line, this is not true, except with a
condition; and in tracing the import of this condition, we
find its necessity becomes evident only when we introduce a
reference to a Limit. And the same is the case if we attempt
to supersede the notion of a Limit in proving any other
simple and evident proposition in which that notion is
involved. Therefore these evident truths are
<em>self</em>-evident, <em>in virtue of the Idea of a
Limit</em>.</div>
<p>The ancients did not expressly introduce this conception of
a Limit into their mathematical reasonings; although in the
application of what is termed the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page153">153</a></span> <i>Method of
Exhaustions</i>, (in which they show how to <i>exhaust</i>
the <i>difference</i> between a polygon and a curve, or the
like,) they were in fact proceeding upon an obscure
apprehension of principles equivalent to those of the Method
of Limits. Yet the necessary fundamental principle not
having, in their time, been clearly developed, their
reasonings were both needlessly intricate and imperfectly
satisfactory. Moreover they were led to put in the place of
axioms, assumptions which were by no means self-evident; as
when Archimedes assumed, for the basis of his measure of the
circumference of the circle, the proposition that a circular
arc is necessarily less than two lines which inclose it,
joining its extremities. The reasonings of the older
mathematicians, which professed to proceed upon such
assumptions, led to true results in reality, only because
they were guided by a latent reference to the limiting case
of such assumptions. And this latent employment of the
conception of a Limit, reappeared in various forms during
the early period of modern mathematics; as for example, in
the <i>Method of Indivisibles</i> of Cavalleri, and the
<i>Characteristic Triangle</i> of Barrow; till at last,
Newton distinctly referred such reasonings to the conception
of a Limit, and established the fundamental principles and
processes which that conception introduces, with a
distinctness and exactness which required little improvement
to make it as unimpeachable as the demonstrations of
geometry. And when such processes as Newton thus deduced
from the conception of a Limit, are represented by means of
general algebraical symbols instead of geometrical diagrams,
we have then before us the <i>Method of Fluxions</i>, or the
<i>Differential Calculus</i>; a mode of treating
mathematical problems justly considered as the principal
weapon by which the splendid triumphs of modern mathematics
have been achieved.</p>
<p id="b2c12s2">2. <i>The Use of General Symbols.</i>&#8212;The employment of
algebraical symbols, of which we have just spoken, has been
another of the main instruments to which the successes of
modern mathematics are owing. And here again the processes
by which we obtain our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page154">154</a></span> results depend for their
evidence upon a fundamental conception,&#8212;the conception of
<i>arbitrary symbols</i> as the <i>Signs</i> of quantity and
its relations; and upon a corresponding axiom, that ‘The
interpretation of such symbols must be perfectly general.’
In this case, as in the last, it was only by degrees that
mathematicians were led to a just apprehension of the
grounds of their reasoning. For symbols were at first used
only to represent numbers considered with regard to their
numerical properties; and thus the science of Algebra was
formed. But it was found, even in cases belonging to common
algebra, that the symbols often admitted of an
interpretation which went beyond the limits of the problem,
and which yet was not unmeaning, since it pointed out a
question closely analogous to the question proposed. This
was the case, for example, when the answer was a <i>negative
quantity</i>; for when Descartes had introduced the mode of
representing curves by means of algebraical relations among
the symbols of the <i>co-ordinates</i>, or distances of each
of their points from fixed lines, it was found that negative
quantities must be dealt with as not less truly significant
than positive ones. And as the researches of mathematicians
proceeded, other cases also were found, in which the
symbols, although destitute of meaning according to the
original conventions of their institution, still pointed out
truths which could be verified in other ways; as in the
cases in which what are called <i>impossible quantities</i>
occur. Such processes may usually be confirmed upon other
principles, and the truth in question may be established by
means of a demonstration in which no such seeming fallacies
defeat the reasoning. But it has also been shown in many
such cases, that the process in which some of the steps
appear to be without real meaning, does in fact involve a
valid proof of the proposition. And what we have here to
remark is, that this is not true accidentally or partially
only, but that the results of systematic symbolical
reasoning must <em>always</em> express general truths, by
their nature; and do not, for their justification, require
each of the steps of the process to represent <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page155">155</a></span> some
definite operation upon quantity. <em>The absolute
universality of the interpretation of symbols</em> is the
fundamental principle of their use. This has been shown very
ably by Dr. Peacock in his <i>Algebra</i>. He has there
illustrated, in a variety of ways, this principle: that ‘If
general symbols express an identity when they are supposed
to be of any special nature, they must also express an
identity when they are general in their nature.’ And thus,
this universality of symbols is a principle in addition to
those we have already noticed; and is a principle of the
greatest importance in the formation of mathematical
science, according to the wide generality which such science
has in modern times assumed.</p>
<p id="b2c12s3">3. <i>Connexion of Symbols and Analysis.</i>&#8212;Since in our
symbolical reasoning our symbols thus reason for us, we do
not necessarily here, as in geometrical reasoning, go on
adding carefully one known truth to another, till we reach
the desired result. On the contrary, if we have a theorem to
prove or a problem to solve which can be brought under the
domain of our symbols, we may at once state the given but
unproved truth, or the given combination of unknown
quantities, in its symbolical form. After this first
process, we may then proceed to trace, by means of our
symbols, what other truth is involved in the one just
stated, or what the unknown symbols must signify; resolving
step by step the symbolical assertion with which we began,
into others more fitted for our purpose. The former process
is a kind of <i>synthesis</i>, the latter is termed
<i>analysis</i>. And although symbolical reasoning does not
necessarily imply such analysis; yet the connexion is so
familiar, that the term <i>analysis</i> is frequently used
to designate symbolical reasoning.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">The Doctrine of Motion.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b2c13s1">1. <i>Pure Mechanism.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">The</span> doctrine of Motion, of which
we have here to speak, is that in which motion is considered
quite independently of its cause, force; for all
consideration of force belongs to a class of ideas entirely
different from those with which we are here concerned. In
this view it may be termed the <i>pure</i> doctrine of
motion, since it has to do solely with space and time, which
are the subjects of pure mathematics. (See <a href="#v1page88">c. i.</a> of this
book.) Although the doctrine of motion in connexion with
force, which is the subject of mechanics, is by far the most
important form in which the consideration of motion enters
into the formation of our sciences, the Pure Doctrine of
Motion, which treats of space, time, and velocity, might be
followed out so as to give rise to a very considerable and
curious body of science. Such a science is the science of
Mechanism, independent of force, and considered as the
solution of a problem which may be thus enunciated: ‘To
communicate any given motion from a first mover to a given
body.’ The science which should have for its object to solve
all the various cases into which this problem would ramify,
might be termed <i>Pure Mechanism</i>, in contradistinction
to <i>Mechanics Proper</i>, or <i>Machinery</i>, in which
Force is taken into consideration. The greater part of the
machines which have been constructed for use in manufactures
have been practical solutions of some of the cases of this
problem. We have also important contributions to such a
science in the works of Mathematicians; for example, the
various investigations and demonstrations which have been
published respecting the form of the Teeth <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page157">157</a></span> of Wheels,
and Mr. Babbage’s memoir<a id="fnanchor15-2" href="#note15-2"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> on the Language of Machinery.
There are also several works which contain collections of
the mechanical contrivances which have been invented for the
purpose of transmitting and modifying motion, and these
works may be considered as treatises on the science of Pure
Mechanism. But this science has not yet been reduced to the
systematic simplicity which is desirable, nor indeed
generally recognized as a separate science. It has been
confounded, under the common name of <i>Mechanics</i>, with
the other <span class="correction" title="emended from sciences, as per Erratum note">science</span>, Mechanics Proper, or Machinery, which
considers the effect of <i>force</i> transmitted by
Mechanism from one part of a material combination to
another. For example, the <i>Mechanical Powers</i>, as they
are usually termed, (the Lever, the Wheel and Axle, the
Inclined Plane, the Wedge, and the Screw,) have almost
always been treated with reference to the relation between
the <i>Power</i> and the <i>Weight</i>, and not primarily as
a mode of changing the velocity and kind of the motion. The
science of pure motion has not generally been separated from
the science of motion viewed with reference to its causes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-2" href="#fnanchor15-2">15</a></span> <i>On a Method of expressing by Signs the action
of Machinery.</i> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1826, p. 250.</div>
<p>Recently, indeed, the necessity of such a separation has
been seen by those who have taken a philosophical view of
science. Thus this necessity has been urged by M. Ampère, in
his <i>Essai sur la Philosophie des Sciences</i> (1834):
‘Long,’ he says, (p. 50,) ‘before I employed myself upon the
present work, I had remarked that it is usual to omit, in
the beginning of all books treating of sciences which regard
motion and force, certain considerations which, duly
developed, must constitute a special science: of which
science certain parts have been treated of, either in
memoirs or in special works; such, for example, as that of
Carnot upon Motion considered Geometrically, and the essay
of Lanz and Betancourt upon the Composition of Machines.’ He
then proceeds to describe this science nearly as we have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page158">158</a></span> done, and proposes to term it <i>Kinematics</i>
(<i>Cinématique</i>), from κίνημα, motion.</p>
<p id="b2c13s2">2. <i>Formal Astronomy.</i>&#8212;I shall not attempt here
further to develop the form which such a science must
assume. But I may notice one very large province which
belongs to it. When men had ascertained the apparent motions
of the sun, moon, and stars, to a moderate degree of
regularity and accuracy, they tried to conceive in their
minds some mechanism by which these motions might be
produced; and thus they in fact proposed to themselves a
very extensive problem in <i>Kinematics</i>. This, indeed,
was the view originally entertained of the nature of the
science of astronomy. Thus Plato in the seventh Book of his
<i>Republic</i><a id="fnanchor16-2" href="#note16-2"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>, speaks of astronomy as the doctrine
of the motion of solids, meaning thereby, spheres. And the
same was a proper description of the science till the time
of Kepler, and even later: for Kepler endeavoured in vain to
conjoin with the knowledge of the motions of the heavenly
bodies, those true mechanical conceptions which converted
formal into physical astronomy<a id="fnanchor17-2" href="#note17-2"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-2" href="#fnanchor16-2">16</a></span> P. 528.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-2" href="#fnanchor17-2">17</a></span> <i>Hist. Induc. Sc.</i> ii. 130.</div>
<p>The astronomy of the ancients admitted none but uniform
circular motions, and could therefore be completely
cultivated by the aid of their elementary geometry. But the
pure science of motion might be extended to all motions,
however varied as to the speed or the path of the moving
body. In this form it must depend upon the doctrine of
limits; and the fundamental principle of its reasonings
would be this: That velocity is measured by the Limit of the
<em>space</em> described, considered with reference to the
<em>time</em> in which it is described. I shall not further
pursue this subject; and in order to complete what I have to
say respecting the Pure Sciences, I have only a few words to
add respecting their bearing on Inductive Science in
general.</p>

<p class="noind">
<span class="dropcap" id="b2c14s1"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> A</span>LL objects in the world which can be made the subjects
of our contemplation are subordinate to the conditions of
Space, Time, and Number; and on this account, the doctrines
of pure mathematics have most numerous and extensive
applications in every department of our investigations of
nature. And there is a peculiarity in these Ideas, which has
caused the mathematical sciences to be, in all cases, the
first successful efforts of the awakening speculative powers
of nations at the commencement of their intellectual
progress. Conceptions derived from these Ideas are, from the
very first, perfectly precise and clear, so as to be fit
elements of scientific truths. This is not the case with the
other conceptions which form the subjects of scientific
inquiries. The conception of <i>statical force</i>, for
instance, was never presented in a distinct form till the
works of Archimedes appeared: the conception of
<i>accelerating force</i> was confused, in the mind of
Kepler and his contemporaries, and only became clear enough
for purposes of sound scientific reasoning in the succeeding
century: the just conception of chemical <i>composition</i>
of elements gradually, in modern times, emerged from the
erroneous and vague notions of the ancients. If we take
works published on such subjects before the epoch when the
foundations of the true science were laid, we find the
knowledge not only small, but worthless. The writers did not
see any evidence in what we now consider as the axioms of
the science; nor any inconsistency where we now see
self-contradiction. But this was never the case with
speculations concerning <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page160">160</a></span> space and number. From their
first rise, these were true as far as they went. The
Geometry and Arithmetic of the Greeks and Indians, even in
their first and most scanty form, contained none but true
propositions. Men’s intuitions upon these subjects never
allowed them to slide into error and confusion; and the
truths to which they were led by the first efforts of their
faculties, so employed, form part of the present stock of
our mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p id="b2c14s2">2. But we are here not so much concerned with mathematics in
their pure form, as with their application to the phenomena
and laws of nature. And here also the very earliest history
of civilization presents to us some of the most remarkable
examples of man’s success in his attempts to attain to
science. Space and time, position and motion, govern all
visible objects; but by far the most conspicuous examples of
the relations which arise out of such elements, are
displayed by the ever-moving luminaries of the sky, which
measure days, and months, and years, by their motions, and
man’s place on the earth by their position. Hence the
sciences of space and number were from the first cultivated
with peculiar reference to Astronomy. I have elsewhere<a id="fnanchor18-2" href="#note18-2"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>
quoted Plato’s remark,&#8212;that it is absurd to call the
science of the relations of space <i>geometry</i>, the
measure of the earth, since its most important office is to
be found in its application to the heavens. And on other
occasions also it appears how strongly he, who may be
considered as the representative of the scientific and
speculative tendencies of his time and country, had been
impressed with the conviction, that the formation of a
science of the celestial motions must depend entirely upon
the progress of mathematics. In the Epilogue to the Dialogue
on the Laws<a id="fnanchor19-2" href="#note19-2"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>, he declares mathematical knowledge to be
the first and main requisite for the astronomer, and
describes the portions of it which he holds necessary for
astronomical speculators to cultivate. These seem to be,
Plane Geometry, Theoretical Arithmetic, the Application of
Arithmetic <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page161">161</a></span> to planes and to solids, and finally the
doctrine of Harmonics. Indeed the bias of Plato appears to
be rather to consider mathematics as the essence of the
science of astronomy, than as its instrument; and he seems
disposed, in this as in other things, to disparage
observation, and to aspire after a science founded upon
demonstration alone. ‘An astronomer,’ he says in the same
place, ‘must not be like Hesiod and persons of that kind,
whose astronomy consists in noting the settings and risings
of the stars; but he must be one who understands the
revolutions of the celestial spheres, each performing its
proper cycle.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-2" href="#fnanchor18-2">18</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. iii. c. ii.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-2" href="#fnanchor19-2">19</a></span> <i>Epinomis</i>, p. 990.</div>
<p>A large portion of the mathematics of the Greeks, so long as
their scientific activity continued, was directed towards
Astronomy. Besides many curious propositions of plane and
solid Geometry, to which their astronomers were led, their
Arithmetic, though very inconvenient in its fundamental
assumptions (as being sexagesimal not decimal), was
cultivated to a great extent; and the science of
Trigonometry, in which problems concerning the relations of
space were resolved by means of tables of numerical results
previously obtained, was created. Menelaus of Alexandria
wrote six Books on Chords, probably containing methods of
calculating Tables of these quantities; such Tables were
familiarly used by the later Greek astronomers. The same
author also wrote three Books on Spherical Trigonometry,
which are still extant.</p>
<p id="b2c14s3">3. The Greeks, however, in the first vigour of their pursuit
of mathematical truth, at the time of Plato and soon after,
had by no means confined themselves to those propositions
which had a visible bearing on the phenomena of nature; but
had followed out many beautiful trains of research,
concerning various kinds of figures, for the sake of their
beauty alone; as for instance in their doctrine of Conic
Sections, of which curves they had discovered all the
principal properties. But it is curious to remark, that
these investigations, thus pursued at first as mere matters
of curiosity and intellectual gratification, were destined,
two thousand years later, to play a very important part in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page162">162</a></span> establishing that system of the celestial motions
which succeeded the Platonic scheme of cycles and epicycles.
If the properties of the conic sections had not been
demonstrated by the Greeks, and thus rendered familiar to
the mathematicians of succeeding ages, Kepler would probably
not have been able to discover those laws respecting the
orbits and motions of the planets which were the occasion of
the greatest revolution that ever happened in the history of
science.</p>
<p id="b2c14s4">4. The Arabians, who, as I have elsewhere said, added little
of their own to the stores of science which they received
from the Greeks, did however make some very important
contributions in those portions of pure mathematics which
are subservient to astronomy. Their adoption of the Indian
mode of computation by means of the Ten Digits, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and by the method of Local Values, instead
of the cumbrous sexagesimal arithmetic of the Greeks, was an
improvement by which the convenience and facility of
numerical calculations were immeasurably augmented. The
Arabians also rendered several of the processes of
trigonometry much more commodious, by using the Sine of an
arc instead of the Chord; an improvement which Albategnius
appears to claim for himself<a id="fnanchor20-2" href="#note20-2"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>; and by employing also
the Tangents of arcs, or, as they called them<a id="fnanchor21-2" href="#note21-2"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>,
<i>upright shadows</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-2" href="#fnanchor21-2">21</a></span> <i>Ibid.</i> p. 17.</div>
<p id="b2c14s5">5. The constant application of mathematical knowledge to the
researches of Astronomy, and the mutual influence of each
science on the progress of the other, has been still more
conspicuous in modern times. Newton’s Method of Prime and
Ultimate Ratios, which we have already noticed as the first
correct exposition of the doctrine of a Limit, is stated in
a series of Lemmas, or preparatory theorems, prefixed to his
<i>Treatise on the System of the World</i>. Both the
properties of curve lines and the doctrines concerning force
and motion, which he had to establish, required that the
common mathematical processes should be methodized and
extended. If Newton had not been a most <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page163">163</a></span> expert and
inventive mathematician, as well as a profound and
philosophical thinker, he could never have made any one of
those vast strides in discovery of which the rapid
succession in his work strikes us with wonder<a id="fnanchor22-2" href="#note22-2"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>. And if
we see that the great task begun by him, goes on more slowly
in the hands of his immediate successors, and lingers a
little before its full completion, we perceive that this
arises, in a great measure, from the defect of the
mathematical methods then used. Newton’s synthetical modes
of investigation, as we have elsewhere observed, were an
instrument<a id="fnanchor23-2" href="#note23-2"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>, powerful indeed in his mighty hand, but
too ponderous for other persons to employ with effect. The
countrymen of Newton clung to it the longest, out of
veneration for their master; and English cultivators of
physical astronomy were, on that very account, left behind
the progress of mathematical science in France and Germany,
by a wide interval, which they have only recently recovered.
On the Continent, the advantages offered by a familiar use
of symbols, and by attention to their symmetry and other
relations, were accepted without reserve. In this manner the
Differential Calculus of Leibnitz, which was in its origin
and signification identical with the Method of Fluxions of
Newton, soon surpassed its rival in the extent and
generality of its application to problems. This Calculus was
applied to the science of mechanics, to which it, along with
the symmetrical use of co-ordinates, gave a new form; for it
was soon seen that the most difficult problems might in
general be reduced to finding integrals, which is the
reciprocal process of that by which differentials are found;
so that all difficulties of physical astronomy were reduced
to difficulties of symbolical calculation, these, indeed,
being often sufficiently stubborn. Clairaut, Euler, and
D’Alembert employed the increased resources of mathematical
science upon the Theory of the Moon, and other questions
relative to the system of the world; and thus began to
pursue such inquiries in the course in which mathematicians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page164">164</a></span> are still labouring up to the present day. This course
was not without its checks and perplexities. We have
elsewhere quoted<a id="fnanchor24-2" href="#note24-2"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a> Clairaut’s expression when he had
obtained the very complex differential equations which
contain the solution of the problem of the moon’s motion:
‘Now integrate them who can!’ But in no very long time they
were integrated, at least approximately; and the methods of
approximation have since then been improved; so that now,
with a due expenditure of labour, they may be carried to any
extent which is thought desirable. If the methods of
astronomical observation should hereafter reach a higher
degree of exactness than they now profess, so that
irregularities in the motions of the sun, moon, and planets,
shall be detected which at present escape us, the
mathematical part of the theory of universal gravitation is
in such a condition that it can soon be brought into
comparison with the newly-observed facts. Indeed at present
the mathematical theory is in advance of such observations.
It can venture to suggest what may afterwards be detected,
as well as to explain what has already been observed. This
has happened recently; for Professor Airy has calculated the
law and amount of an inequality depending upon the mutual
attraction of the Earth and Venus; of which inequality (so
small is it,) it remains to be determined whether its effect
can be traced in the series of astronomical observations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-2" href="#fnanchor22-2">22</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vii. c. ii.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-2" href="#fnanchor23-2">23</a></span> <i>Ibid.</i> p. 175.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-2" href="#fnanchor24-2">24</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vi. c. vi. sect. 7.</div>
<p id="b2c14s6">6. As the influence of mathematics upon the progress of
astronomy is thus seen in the cases in which theory and
observation confirm each other, so this influence appears in
another way, in the very few cases in which the facts have
not been fully reduced to an agreement with theory. The most
conspicuous case of this kind is the state of our knowledge
of the Tides. This is a portion of astronomy: for the
Newtonian theory asserts these curious phenomena to be the
result of the attraction of the sun and moon. Nor can there
be any doubt that this is true, as a general statement; yet
the subject is up to the present time a blot <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page165">165</a></span> on the
perfection of the theory of universal gravitation; for we
are very far from being able in this, as in the other parts
of astronomy, to show that theory will exactly account for
the time, and magnitude, and all other circumstances of the
phenomenon at every place on the earth’s surface. And what
is the portion of our mathematics which is connected with
this solitary signal defect in astronomy? It is the
mathematics of the Motion of Fluids; a portion in which
extremely little progress has been made, and in which all
the more general problems of the subject have hitherto
remained entirely insoluble. The attempts of the greatest
mathematicians, Newton, Maclaurin, Bernoulli, Clairaut,
Laplace, to master such questions, all involve some
gratuitous assumption, which is introduced because the
problem cannot otherwise be mathematically dealt with: these
assumptions confessedly render the result defective, and how
defective, it is hard to say. And it was probably precisely
the absence of a theory which could be reasonably expected
to agree with the observations, which made Observations of
this very curious phenomenon, the Tides, to be so much
neglected as till very recently they were. Of late years
such observations have been pursued, and their results have
been resolved into empirical laws, so that the rules of the
phenomena have been ascertained, although the dependence of
these rules upon the lunar and solar forces has not been
shown. Here then we have a portion of our knowledge relating
to facts undoubtedly dependent upon universal gravitation,
in which Observation has outstripped Theory in her progress,
and is compelled to wait till her usual companion overtakes
her. This is a position of which Mathematical Theory has
usually been very impatient, and we may expect that she will
be no less so in the present instance.</p>
<p id="b2c14s7">7. It would be easy to show from the history of other
sciences, for example, Mechanics and Optics, how essential
the cultivation of pure mathematics has been to their
progress. The parabola was already familiar among
mathematicians when Galileo discovered that it was the
theoretical path of a Projectile; and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page166">166</a></span> extension
and generalization of the Laws of Motion could never have
been effected, unless the Differential and Integral Calculus
had been at hand, ready to trace the results of every
hypothesis which could be made. D’Alembert’s mode of
expressing the Third Law of Motion in its most general
form<a id="fnanchor25-2" href="#note25-2"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>, if it did not prove the law, at least reduced
the application of it to analytical processes which could be
performed in most of those cases in which they were needed.
In many instances the demands of mechanical science
suggested the extension of the methods of pure analysis. The
problem of Vibrating Strings gave rise to the Calculus of
Partial Differences, which was still further stimulated by
its application to the motions of fluids and other
mechanical problems. And we have in the writings of Lagrange
and Laplace other instances equally remarkable of new
analytical methods, to which mechanical problems, and
especially cosmical problems, have given occasion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-2" href="#fnanchor25-2">25</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vi. c. vi. sect. 7.</div>
<p id="b2c14s8">8. The progress of Optics as a science has, in like manner,
been throughout dependent upon the progress of pure
mathematics. The first rise of Geometry was followed by some
advances, slight ones no doubt, in the doctrine of
Reflection and in Perspective. The law of Refraction was
traced to its consequences by means of Trigonometry, which
indeed was requisite to express the law in a simple form.
The steps made in Optical science by Descartes, Newton,
Euler, and Huyghens, required the geometrical skill which
those philosophers possessed. And if Young and Fresnel had
not been, each in his peculiar way, persons of eminent
mathematical endowments, they would not have been able to
bring the Theory of Undulations and Interferences into a
condition in which it could be tested by experiments. We may
see how unexpectedly recondite parts of pure mathematics may
bear upon physical science, by calling to mind a
circumstance already noticed in the History of
Science<a id="fnanchor26-2" href="#note26-2"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>;&#8212;that Fresnel obtained one of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page167">167</a></span> most
curious confirmations of the theory (the laws of Circular
Polarization by reflection) through an interpretation of an
algebraical expression, which, according to the original
conventional meaning of the symbols, involved an impossible
quantity. We have already remarked, that in virtue of the
principle of the generality of symbolical language, such an
interpretation may often point out some real and important
analogy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-2" href="#fnanchor26-2">26</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. ix. c. xiii. sect. 2.</div>
<p id="b2c14s9">9. From this rapid sketch it may be seen how important an
office in promoting the progress of the physical sciences
belongs to mathematics. Indeed in the progress of many
sciences, every step has been so intimately connected with
some advance in mathematics, that we can hardly be surprised
if some persons have considered mathematical reasoning to be
the most essential part of such sciences; and have
overlooked the other elements which enter into their
formation. How erroneous this view is we shall best see by
turning our attention to the other Ideas besides those of
space, number, and motion, which enter into some of the most
conspicuous and admired portions of what is termed exact
science; and by showing that the clear and distinct
development of such Ideas is quite as necessary to the
progress of exact and real knowledge as an acquaintance with
arithmetic and geometry.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">In</span>
the History of the Sciences, that class of which we here
speak occupies a conspicuous and important place; coming
into notice immediately after those parts of Astronomy which
require for their cultivation merely the ideas of space,
time, motion, and number. It appears from our History, that
certain truths concerning the <i>equilibrium</i> of bodies
were established by Archimedes;&#8212;that, after a long interval
of inactivity, his principles were extended and pursued
further in modern times:&#8212;and that to these doctrines
concerning equilibrium and the forces which produce it,
(which constitute the science <i>Statics</i>,) were added
many other doctrines concerning the <i>motions</i> of
bodies, considered also as produced by forces, and thus the
science of <i>Dynamics</i> was produced. The assemblage of
these sciences composes the province of <i>Mechanics</i>.
Moreover, philosophers have laboured to make out the laws of
the equilibrium of <i>fluid</i> as well as solid bodies; and
hence has arisen the science of <i>Hydrostatics</i>. And the
doctrines of Mechanics have been found to have a most
remarkable bearing upon the motions of the heavenly bodies;
with reference to which, indeed, they were at first
principally studied. The explanation of those cosmical facts
by means of mechanical <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page172">172</a></span> principles and their
consequences, forms the science of <i>Physical
Astronomy</i>. These are the principal examples of
mechanical science; although some other portions of Physics,
as Magnetism and Electrodynamics, introduce mechanical
doctrines very largely into their speculations.</p>
<p>Now in all these sciences we have to consider <i>Forces</i>.
In all mechanical reasonings forces enter, either as
producing motion, or as prevented from doing so by other
forces. Thus force, in its most general sense, is the
<em>cause</em> of motion, or of tendency to motion; and in
order to discover the principles on which the mechanical
sciences truly rest, we must examine the nature and origin
of our knowledge of Causes.</p>
<p>In these sciences, however, we have not to deal with Cause
in its more general acceptation, in which it applies to all
kinds of agency, material or immaterial;&#8212;to the influence
of thought and will, as well as of bodily pressure and
attractive force. Our business at present is only with such
causes as immediately operate upon matter. We shall
nevertheless, in the first place, consider the nature of
Cause in its most general form; and afterwards narrow our
speculations so as to direct them specially to the
mechanical sciences.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>

see in the world around us a constant succession of
causes and effects connected with each other. The laws of
this connexion we learn in a great measure from experience,
by observation of the occurrences which present themselves
to our notice, succeeding one another. But in doing this,
and in attending to this succession of appearances, of which
we are aware by means of our senses, we supply from our own
minds the Idea of Cause. This Idea, as we have already shown
with respect to other Ideas, is not derived from experience,
but has its origin in the mind itself;&#8212;is introduced into
our experience by the active, and not by the passive part of
our nature.</p>
<p>By Cause we mean some quality, power, or efficacy, by which
a state of things produces a succeeding state. Thus the
motion of bodies from rest is produced by a cause which we
call <i>Force</i>: and in the particular case in which
bodies fall to the earth, this force is termed
<i>Gravity</i>. In these cases, the Conceptions of Force and
Gravity receive their meaning from the Idea of Cause which
they involve: for Force is conceived as the Cause of Motion.
That this Idea of Cause is not derived from experience, we
prove (as in former cases) by this consideration: that we
can make assertions, involving this idea, which are
rigorously necessary and universal; whereas knowledge
derived from experience can only be true as far as
experience goes, and can never contain in itself any
evidence whatever of its necessity. We assert that ‘Every
event must have a cause:’ and this proposition we know to be
true, not only probably, and generally, and as far as we can
see: <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page174">174</a></span> but we cannot suppose it to be false in any
single instance. We are as certain of it as of the truths of
arithmetic or geometry. We cannot doubt that it must apply
to all events past and future, in every part of the
universe, just as truly as to those occurrences which we
have ourselves observed. <em>What</em> causes produce what
effects;&#8212;what is the cause of any particular event;&#8212;what
will be the effect of any peculiar process;&#8212;these are
points on which experience may enlighten us. Observation and
experience may be requisite, to enable us to judge
respecting such matters. But that every event has
<em>some</em> cause, Experience cannot prove any more than
she can disprove. She can add nothing to the evidence of the
truth, however often she may exemplify it. This doctrine,
then, cannot have been acquired by her teaching; and the
Idea of Cause, which the doctrine involves, and on which it
depends, cannot have come into our minds from the region of
observation.</p>
<p id="b3c2s2">2. That we do, in fact, apply the Idea of Cause in a more
extensive manner than could be justified, if it were derived
from experience only, is easily shown. For from the
principle that everything must have a cause, we not only
reason concerning the succession of the events which occur
in the progress of the world, and which form the course of
experience; but we infer that the world itself must have a
cause;&#8212;that the chain of events connected by common
causation, must have a First Cause of a nature different
from the events themselves. This we are entitled to do, if
our Idea of Cause be independent of, and superior to,
experience: but if we have no Idea of Cause except such as
we gather from experience, this reasoning is altogether
baseless and unmeaning.</p>
<p id="b3c2s3">3. Again; by the use of our powers of observation, we are
aware of a succession of appearances and events. But none of
our senses or powers of external observation can detect in
these appearances the power or quality which we call Cause.
Cause is that which connects one event with another; but no
sense or perception discloses to us, or can disclose, any
connexion <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page175">175</a></span> among the events which we observe. We see
that one occurrence follows another, but we can never see
anything which shows that one occurrence <em>must</em>
follow another. We have already noticed<a id="fnanchor1-3" href="#note1-3"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>, that this
truth has been urged by metaphysicians in modern times, and
generally assented to by those who examine carefully the
connexion of their own thoughts. The arguments are, indeed,
obvious enough. One ball strikes another and causes it to
move forwards. But by what compulsion? Where is the
necessity? If the mind can see any circumstance in this case
which makes the result inevitable, let this circumstance be
pointed out. But, in fact, there is no such discoverable
necessity; for we can conceive this event not to take place
at all. The struck ball may stand still, for aught we can
see. ‘But the laws of motion will not allow it to do so.’
Doubtless they will not. But the laws of motion are learnt
from experience, and therefore can prove no necessity. Why
should not the laws of motion be other than they are? Are
they necessarily true? That they are necessarily such as do
actually regulate the impact of bodies, is at least no
obvious truth; and therefore this necessity cannot be, in
common minds, the ground of connecting the impact of one
ball with the motion of another. And assuredly, if this
fail, no other ground of such necessary connexion can be
shown. In this case, then, the events are not seen to be
necessarily connected. But if this case, where one ball
moves another by impulse, be not an instance of events
exhibiting a necessary connexion, we shall look in vain for
any example of such a connexion. There is, then, no case in
which events can be observed to be necessarily connected:
our idea of causation, which implies that the event is
necessarily connected with the cause, cannot be derived from
observation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-3" href="#fnanchor1-3">1</a></span> Book <span class="correction" title="emended from 1">3</span>. <a href="#v1page173">chap. <span class="correction" title="emended from xii">ii</span>.</a></div>
<p id="b3c2s4">4. But it may be said, we have not any such Idea of Cause,
implying necessary connexion with effect, and a quality by
which this connexion is produced. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page176">176</a></span> We see nothing but
the succession of events; and by <i>cause</i> we mean
nothing but a certain succession of events;&#8212;namely, a
constant, unvarying succession. Cause and effect are only
two events of which the second invariably follows the first.
We delude ourselves when we imagine that our idea of
causation involves anything more.</p>
<p>To this I reply by asking, what then is the meaning of the
maxim above quoted, and allowed by all to be universally and
necessarily true, that every event must have a cause? Let us
put this maxim into the language of the explanation just
noticed; and it becomes this:&#8212;‘Every event must have a
certain other event invariably preceding it.’ But why must
it? Where is the necessity? Why must like events always be
preceded by like, except so far as other events interfere?
That there is such a necessity, no one can doubt. All will
allow that if a stone ascend because it is thrown upwards in
one case, a stone which ascends in another case has also
been thrown upwards, or has undergone some equivalent
operation. All will allow that in this sense, every kind of
event must have some other specific kind of event preceding
it. But this turn of men’s thoughts shows that they see in
events a connexion which is not mere succession. They see in
cause and effect, not merely what does, often or always,
precede and follow, but what <em>must</em> precede and
follow. The events are not only conjoined, they are
connected. The cause is more than the prelude, the effect is
more than the sequel, of the fact. The cause is conceived
not as a mere occasion; it is a power, an efficacy, which
has a real operation.</p>
<p id="b3c2s5">5. Thus we have drawn from the maxim, that Every Effect must
have a Cause, arguments to show that we have an Idea of
Cause which is not borrowed from experience, and which
involves more than mere succession. Similar arguments might
be derived from any other maxims of universal and necessary
validity, which we can obtain concerning Cause: as, for
example, the maxims that Causes are measured by their
Effects, and that Reaction is equal and opposite to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page177">177</a></span>
Action. These maxims we shall soon have to examine; but we
may observe here, that the necessary truth which belongs to
them, shows that they, and the Ideas which they involve, are
not the mere fruits of observation; while their meaning,
including, as it does, something quite different from the
mere conception of succession of events, proves that such a
conception is far from containing the whole import and
signification of our Idea of Cause.</p>
<p>The progress of the opinions of philosophers on the points
discussed in this chapter, has been one of the most
remarkable parts of the history of Metaphysics in modern
times: and I shall therefore briefly notice some of its
features.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page178"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Modern Opinions respecting the Idea of Cause.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b3c3s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>OWARDS the end of the seventeenth century there existed
in the minds of many of the most vigorous and active
speculators of the European literary world, a strong
tendency to ascribe the whole of our Knowledge to the
teaching of Experience. This tendency, with its
consequences, including among them the reaction which was
produced when the tenet had been pushed to a length
manifestly absurd, has exercised a very powerful influence
upon the progress of metaphysical doctrines up to the
present time. I proceed to notice some of the most prominent
of the opinions which have thus obtained prevalence among
philosophers, so far as the Idea of Cause is concerned.</p>
<p>Locke was one of the metaphysicians who produced the
greatest effect in diffusing this opinion, of the exclusive
dependence of our knowledge upon experience. Agreeably to
this general system, he taught<a id="fnanchor2-3" href="#note2-3"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> that our ideas of Cause
and Effect are got from observation of the things about us.
Yet notwithstanding this tenet of his, he endeavoured still
to employ these ideas in reasoning on subjects which are far
beyond all limits of experience: for he professed to prove,
from our idea of Causation, the existence of the Deity<a id="fnanchor3-3" href="#note3-3"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-3" href="#fnanchor2-3">2</a></span> <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>, b. ii.
c. xxvi.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-3" href="#fnanchor3-3">3</a></span>  B. iv. c. x.</div>
<p>Hume noticed this obvious inconsistency; but declared
himself unable to discover any remedy for a defect so fatal
to the most important parts of our knowledge. He could see,
in our belief of the succession of cause and effect, nothing
but the habit of associating in our minds what had often
been <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page179">179</a></span> associated in our experience. He therefore
maintained that we could not, with logical propriety, extend
our belief of such a succession to cases entirely distinct
from all those of which our experience consisted. We see, he
said, an actual <em>conjunction</em> of two events; but we
can in no way detect a necessary <em>connexion</em>; and
therefore we have no means of inferring cause from effect,
or effect from cause<a id="fnanchor4-3" href="#note4-3"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>. The only way in which we
recognize Cause and Effect in the field of our experience,
is as an unfailing Sequence: we look in vain for anything
which can assure us of an infallible Consequence. And since
experience is the only source of our knowledge, we cannot
with any justice assert that the world in which we live must
necessarily have had a cause.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-3" href="#fnanchor4-3">4</a></span> Hume’s <i>Phil. of the Human Mind</i>, vol. i. p. 94.</div>
<p id="b3c3s2">2. This doctrine, taken in conjunction with the known
skepticism of its author on religious points, produced a
considerable fermentation in the speculative world. The
solution of the difficulty thus thrown before philosophers,
was by no means obvious. It was vain to endeavour to find in
experience any other property of a Cause, than a constant
sequence of the effect. Yet it was equally vain to try to
persuade men that they had no idea of Cause; or even to
shake their belief in the cogency of the familiar arguments
concerning the necessity of an original cause of all that is
and happens. Accordingly these hostile and apparently
irreconcilable doctrines,&#8212;the indispensable necessity of a
cause of every event, and the impossibility of our knowing
such a necessity,&#8212;were at last allowed to encamp side by
side. Reid, Beattie, and others, formed one party, who
showed how widely and constantly the idea of a cause
pervades all the processes of the human mind: while another
sect, including Brown, and apparently Stewart, maintained
that this idea is always capable of being resolved into a
constant sequence; and these latter reasoners tried to
obviate the dangerous and shocking inferences which some
persons might try to draw from their opinion, by declaring
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page180">180</a></span> maxim that “Every event must have a cause,” to be
an instinctive law of belief, or a fundamental principle of
the human mind<a id="fnanchor5-3" href="#note5-3"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-3" href="#fnanchor5-3">5</a></span> Stewart’s <i>Active Powers</i>, vol. i. p. 347.
Browne’s <i>Lectures</i>, vol. i. p. 115.</div>
<p id="b3c3s3">3. While this series of discussions was going on in Britain,
a great metaphysical genius in Germany was unravelling the
perplexity in another way. Kant’s speculations originated,
as he informs us, in the trains of thought to which Hume’s
writings gave rise; and the <i>Kritik der Reinen
Vernunft</i>, or <i>Examination of the Pure Reason</i>, was
published in 1787, with the view of showing the true nature
of our knowledge.</p>
<p>Kant’s solution of the difficulties just mentioned differs
materially from that above stated. According to Brown<a id="fnanchor6-3" href="#note6-3"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>,
succession observed and cause inferred,&#8212;the memory of past
conjunctions of events and the belief of similar future
conjunctions,&#8212;are facts, independent, so far as we can
discover, but inseparably combined by a law of our mental
nature. According to Kant, causality is an inseparable
condition of our experience: a connexion in events is
requisite to our apprehending them <em>as</em> events.
Future occurrences must be connected by causation as the
past have been, because we cannot think of past, present,
and future, without such connexion. We cannot fix the mind
upon occurrences, without including these occurrences in a
series of causes and effects. The relation of Causation is a
condition under which we think of events, as the relations
of space are a condition under which we see objects.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-3" href="#fnanchor6-3">6</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, vol. i. p. 114.</div>
<p id="b3c3s4">4. On a subject so abstruse, it is not easy to make our
distinctions very clear. Some of Brown’s illustrations
appear to approach very near to the doctrine of Kant. Thus
he says<a id="fnanchor7-3" href="#note7-3"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>, ‘The <em>form</em> of bodies is the relation
of their elements to each other in space,&#8212;the
<em>power</em> of bodies is their relation to each other in
time.’ Yet notwithstanding such approximations in
expression, the Kantian doctrine appears to be different
from <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page181">181</a></span> the views of Stewart and Brown, as commonly
understood. According to the Scotch philosophers, the cause
and the effect are two things, connected in our minds by a
law of our nature. But this view requires us to suppose that
we can conceive the law to be absent, and the course of
events to be unconnected. If we can understand what is the
special force of this law, we must be able to imagine what
the case would be if the law were non-existing. We must be
able to conceive a mind which does not connect effects with
causes. The Kantian doctrine, on the other hand, teaches
that we cannot imagine events liberated from the connexion
of cause and effect: this connexion is a condition of our
conceiving any real occurrences: we cannot think of a real
sequence of things, except as involving the operation of
causes. In the Scotch system, the past and the future are in
their nature independent, but bound together by a rule; in
the German system, they share in a common nature and mutual
relation, by the act of thought which makes them past and
future. In the former doctrine cause is a tie which binds;
in the latter it is a character which pervades and shapes
events. The Scotch metaphysicians only assert the
<em>universality</em> of the relation; the German attempts
further to explain its <em>necessity</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-3" href="#fnanchor7-3">7</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, vol. i. p. 127.</div>
<p>This being the state of the case, such illustrations as that
of Dr. Brown quoted above, in which he represents
<em>cause</em> as a relation of the same kind with
<em>form</em>, do not appear exactly to fit his opinions.
Can the relations of figure be properly said to be connected
with each other by a law of our nature, or a tendency of our
mental constitution? Can we ascribe it to a law of our
thoughts, that we believe the three angles of a triangle to
be equal to two right angles? If so, we must give the same
reason for our belief that two straight lines cannot inclose
a space; or that three and two are five. But will any one
refer us to an ultimate law of our constitution for the
belief that three and two are five? Do we not see that they
are so, as plainly as we see that they are three and two?
Can we imagine laws of our constitution abolished, so that
three and two shall <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page182">182</a></span> make something different from
five;&#8212;so that an inclosed space shall lie between two
straight lines;&#8212;so that the three angles of a plane
triangle shall be greater than two right angles? We cannot
conceive this. If the numbers <em>are</em> three and two; if
the lines <em>are</em> straight; if the triangle <em>is</em>
a rectilinear triangle, the consequences are inevitable. We
cannot even imagine the contrary. We do not want a law to
direct that things should be what they are. The relation,
then, of cause and effect, being of the same kind as the
necessary relations of figure and number, is not properly
spoken of as established in our minds by a special law of
our constitution: for we reject that loose and inappropriate
phraseology which speaks of the relations of figure and
number as ‘determined by laws of belief.’</p>
<p id="b3c3s5">5. In the present work, we accept and adopt, as the basis of
our inquiry concerning our knowledge, the existence of
necessary truths concerning causes, as there exist necessary
truths concerning figure and number. We find such truths
universally established and assented to among the
cultivators of science, and among speculative men in
general. All mechanicians agree that reaction is equal and
opposite to action, both when one body presses another, and
when one body communicates motion to another. All reasoners
join in the assertion, not only that every observed change
of motion has had a cause, but that every change of motion
must have a cause. Here we have certain portions of
substantial and undoubted knowledge. Now the essential point
in the view which we must take of the idea of cause is
this,&#8212;that our view must be such as to form a solid basis
for our knowledge. We have, in the Mechanical Sciences,
certain universal and necessary truths on the subject of
causes. Now any view which refers our belief in causation to
mere experience or habit, cannot explain the possibility of
such necessary truths, since experience and habit can never
lead to a perception of necessary connexion. But a view
which teaches us to acknowledge axioms concerning cause, as
we acknowledge axioms <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page183">183</a></span> concerning space, will lead us
to look upon the science of mechanics as equally certain and
universal with the science of geometry; and will thus
materially affect our judgment concerning the nature and
claims of our scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Axioms concerning Cause, or concerning Force, which as we
shall see, is a modification of Cause, will flow from an
Idea of Cause, just as axioms concerning space and number
flow from the ideas of space and number or time. And thus
the propositions which constitute the science of Mechanics
prove that we possess an idea of cause, in the same sense in
which the propositions of geometry and arithmetic prove our
possession of the ideas of space and of time or number.</p>
<p id="b3c3s6">6. The idea of cause, like the ideas of space and time, is a
part of the <em>active</em> powers of the mind. The relation
of cause and effect is a relation or condition under which
events are apprehended, which relation is not given by
observation, but supplied by the mind itself. According to
the views which explain our apprehension of cause by
reference to habit, or to a supposed law of our mental
nature, causal connexion is a consequence of agencies which
the mind passively obeys; but according to the view to which
we are led, this connexion is a result of faculties which
the mind actively exercises. And thus the relation of cause
and effect is a condition of our apprehending successive
events, a part of the mind’s constant and universal
activity, a source of necessary truths; or, to sum all this
in one phrase, a Fundamental Idea.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page184"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Axioms which relate to the Idea of Cause.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b3c4s1">1. <i>Causes are abstract Conceptions.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">We</span> have now to
express, as well as we can, the fundamental character of
that Idea of Cause of which we have just proved the
existence. This may be done, at least for purposes of
reasoning, in this as in former instances, by means of
axioms. I shall state the principal axioms which belong to
this subject, referring the reader to his own thoughts for
the axiomatic evidence which belongs to them.</p>
<p>But I must first observe, that in order to express general
and abstract truths concerning cause and effect, these
terms, <i>cause</i> and <i>effect</i>, must be understood in
a general and abstract manner. When one event gives rise to
another, the first <em>event</em> is, in common language,
often called the cause, and the second the effect. Thus the
meeting of two billiard-balls may be said to be the cause of
one of them turning aside out of the path in which it was
moving. For our present purposes, however, we must not apply
the term cause to such occurrences as this meeting and
turning, but to a certain conception, <i>force</i>,
abstracted from all such special events, and considered as a
quality or property by which one body affects the motion of
the other. And in like manner in other cases, cause is to be
conceived as some abstract quality, power, or efficacy, by
which change is produced; a quality not identical with the
events, but disclosed by means of them. Not only is this
abstract mode of conceiving force and cause useful in
expressing the fundamental principles of science; but it
supplies us with the only mode by which such principles can
be <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page185">185</a></span> stated in a general manner, and made to lead to
substantial truth and real knowledge.</p>
<p>Understanding <i>cause</i>, therefore, in this sense, we
proceed to our Axioms.</p>
<p id="b3c4s2">2. First Axiom. <em>Nothing can take place without a
Cause.</em></p>
<p>Every event, of whatever kind, must have a cause in the
sense of the term which we have just indicated; and that it
must, is a universal and necessary proposition to which we
irresistibly assent as soon as it is understood. We believe
each appearance to come into existence,&#8212;we conceive every
change to take place,&#8212;not only with something preceding it,
but something by which it is made to be what it is. An
effect without a cause;&#8212;an event without a preceding
condition involving the efficacy by which the event is
produced;&#8212;are suppositions which we cannot for a moment
admit. That the connexion of effect with cause is universal
and necessary, is a universal and constant conviction of
mankind. It persists in the minds of all men, undisturbed by
all the assaults of sophistry and skepticism; and, as we
have seen in the last chapter, remains unshaken, even when
its foundations seem to be ruined. This axiom expresses, to
a certain extent, our Idea of Cause; and when that idea is
clearly apprehended, the axiom requires no proof, and indeed
admits of none which makes it more evident. That
notwithstanding its simplicity, it is of use in our
speculations, we shall hereafter see; but in the first
place, we must consider the other axioms belonging to this
subject.</p>
<p id="b3c4s3">3. Second Axiom. <em>Effects are proportional to their
Causes, and Causes are measured by their Effects.</em></p>
<p>We have already said that <i>cause</i> is that quality or
power, in the circumstances of each case, by which the
effect is produced; and this power, an abstract property of
the condition of things to which it belongs, can in no way
fall directly under the cognizance of the senses. Cause, of
whatever kind, is not apprehended as including objects and
events which share its nature by being co-extensive with
certain portions of it, as space and time are. It cannot
therefore, like them, be <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page186">186</a></span> measured by repetition of its
own parts, as space is measured by repetition of inches, and
time by repetition of minutes. Causes may be greater or
less; as, for instance, the force of a man is greater than
the force of a child. But how much is the one greater than
the other? How are we to compare the abstract conception,
force, in such cases as these?</p>
<p>To this, the obvious and only answer is, that we must
compare causes by means of their effects;&#8212;that we must
compare force by something which force can do. The child can
lift one fagot; the man can lift ten such fagots: we have
here a means of comparison. And whether or not the rule is
to be applied in this manner, that is, by the number of
things operated on, (a question which we shall have to
consider hereafter,) it is clear that this form of rule,
namely, a reference to some effect or other as our measure,
is the right, because the only possible form. The cause
determines the effect. The cause being the same, the effect
must be the same. The connexion of the two is governed by a
fixed and inviolable rule. It admits of no ambiguity. Every
degree of intensity in the cause has some peculiar
modification of the effect corresponding to it. Hence the
effect is an unfailing index of the amount of the cause; and
if it be a measurable effect, gives a measure of the cause.
We can have no other measure; but we need no other, for this
is exact, sufficient and complete.</p>
<p>It may be said, that various effects are produced by the
same cause. The sun’s heat melts wax and expands
quicksilver. The force of gravity causes bodies to move
downwards if they are free, and to press down upon their
supports if they are supported. Which of the effects is to
be taken as the measure of heat, or of gravity, in these
cases? To this we reply, that if we had merely different
states of the same cause to compare, any of the effects
might be taken. The sun’s heat on different days might be
measured by the expansion of quicksilver, or by the quantity
of wax melted. The force of gravity, if it were different at
different places, might be measured by the spaces through
which a given weight would bend an elastic <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page187">187</a></span> support, or
by the spaces through which a body would fall in a given
time. All these measures are consistent with the general
character of our idea of cause.</p>
<p id="b3c4s4">4. <i>Limitation of the Second Axiom.</i>&#8212;But there may be
circumstances in the nature of the case which may further
determine the kind of effect which we must take for the
measure of the cause. For example, if causes are conceived
to be of such a nature as to be capable of addition, the
effects taken as their measure must conform to this
condition. This is the case with mechanical causes. The
weights of two bodies are the causes of the pressure which
they exert downwards; and these weights are capable of
addition. The weight of the two is the sum of the weight of
each. We are therefore not at liberty to say that weights
shall be measured by the spaces through which they bend a
certain elastic support, except we have first ascertained
that the whole weight bends it through a space equal to the
sum of the inflections produced by the separate weights.
Without this precaution, we might obtain inconsistent
results. Two weights, each of the magnitude 3 as measured by
their effects, might, if we took the inflections of a spring
for the effects, be together equal to 5 or to 7 by the same
kind of measurement. For the inflection produced by two
weights of 3 might, for aught we can see beforehand, be more
or less than twice as great as the inflection produced by
one weight of 3. That forces are capable of addition, is a
condition which limits, and, as we shall see, in some cases
rigorously fixes, the kind of effects which are to be taken
as their measures.</p>
<p>Causes which are thus capable of addition are to be measured
by the repeated addition of equal quantities. Two such
causes are <em>equal</em> to each other when they produce
exactly the same effect. So far our axiom is applied
directly. But these two causes can be <em>added</em>
together; and being thus added, they are <em>double</em> of
one of them; and the cause composed by addition of
<em>three</em> such, is <em>three</em> times as great as the
first; and so on for any measure whatever. By this means,
and by this <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page188">188</a></span> means only, we have a complete and
consistent measure of those causes which are so conceived as
to be subject to this condition of being added and
multiplied.</p>
<p>Causes are, in the present chapter, to be understood in the
widest sense of the term; and the axiom now under our
consideration applies to them, whenever they are of such a
nature as to admit of any measure at all. But the cases
which we have more particularly in view are
<em>mechanical</em> causes, the causes of the motion and of
the equilibrium of bodies. In these cases, forces are
conceived as capable of addition; and what has been said of
the measure of causes in such cases, applies peculiarly to
mechanical forces. Two weights, placed together, may be
considered as a single weight, equal to the <em>sum</em> of
the two. Two pressures, pushing a body in the same direction
at the same point, are identical in all respects with some
single pressure, their <em>sum</em>, pushing in like manner;
and this is true whether or not they put the body in motion.
In the cases of mechanical forces, therefore, we take some
certain effect, velocity generated or weight supported,
which may fix the <i>unit</i> of force; and we then measure
all other forces by the successive repetition of this unit,
as we measure all spaces by the successive repetition of our
unit of lineal measure.</p>
<p>But these steps in the formation of the science of Mechanics
will be further explained, when we come to follow our axioms
concerning cause into their application in that science. At
present we have, perhaps, sufficiently explained the axiom
that causes are measured by their effects, and we now
proceed to a third axiom, also of great importance.</p>
<p id="b3c4s5">5. Third Axiom. <em>Reaction is equal and opposite to
Action.</em></p>
<p>In the case of mechanical forces, the action of a cause
often takes place by an operation of one body upon another;
and in this case, the action is always and inevitably
accompanied by an <em>opposite</em> action. If I press a
stone with my hand, the stone presses my hand in return. If
one ball strike another and put it in motion, the second
ball diminishes the motion of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page189">189</a></span> the first. In these
cases the operation is mutual; the Action is accompanied by
a Reaction. And in all such cases the Reaction is a force of
exactly the same nature as the Action, exerted in an
opposite direction. A pressure exerted upon a body at rest
is resisted and balanced by another pressure; when the
pressure of one body puts another in motion, the body,
though it yields to the force, nevertheless exerts upon the
pressing body a force like that which it suffers.</p>
<p>Now the axiom asserts further, that this Reaction is
<em>equal</em>, as well as opposite, to the Action. For the
Reaction is an effect of the Action, and is determined by
it. And since the two, Action and Reaction, are forces of
the same nature, each may be considered as cause and as
effect; and they must, therefore, determine each other by a
common rule. But this consideration leads necessarily to
their equality: for since the rule is mutual, if we could
for an instant suppose the Reaction to be less than the
Action, we must, by the same rule, suppose the Action to be
less than the Reaction. And thus Action and Reaction, in
every such case, are rigorously equal to each other.</p>
<p>It is easily seen that this axiom is not a proposition which
is, or can be, proved by experience; but that its truth is
anterior to special observation, and depends on our
conception of Action and Reaction. Like our other axioms,
this has its source in an Idea; namely, the Idea of Cause,
under that particular condition in which cause and effect
are mutual. The necessary and universal truth which we
cannot help ascribing to the axiom, shows that it is not
derived from the stores of experience, which can never
contain truths of this character. Accordingly, it was
asserted with equal confidence and generality by those who
did not refer to experience for their principles, and by
those who did. Leonicus Tomæus, a commentator of Aristotle,
whose work was published in 1552, and therefore at a period
when no right opinions concerning mechanical reaction were
current, at least in his school, says, in his remarks on the
Author’s Questions concerning the communication of motion,
that ‘Reaction is equal and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page190">190</a></span> contrary to Action.’ The
same principle was taken for granted by all parties, in all
the controversies concerning the proper measure of force, of
which we shall have to speak: and would be rigorously true,
as a law of motion, whichever of the rival interpretations
of the measure of the term ‘Action’ we were to take.</p>
<p id="b3c4s6">6. <i>Extent of the Third Axiom.</i>&#8212;It may naturally be
asked whether this third Axiom respecting causation extends
to any other cases than those of mechanical action, since
the notion of Cause in general has certainly a much wider
extent. For instance, when a hot body heats a cold one, is
there necessarily an equal reaction of the second body upon
the first? Does the snowball cool the boy’s hand exactly as
much as the hand heats the snow? To this we reply, that, in
every case in which one body acts upon another by its
physical qualities, there must be some reaction. No body can
affect another without being itself also affected. But in
any physical change the <em>action</em> exerted is an
abstract term which may be variously understood. The hot
hand may <em>melt</em> a cool body, or may <em>warm</em> it:
which kind of effect is to be taken as action? This remains
to be determined by other considerations.</p>
<p>In all cases of physical change produced by one body in
another, it is generally possible to assume such a meaning
of action, that the reaction shall be of the same nature as
the action; and when this is done, the third axiom of
causation, that reaction is equal to action, is universally
true. Thus if a hot body heat a cold one, the change may be
conceived as the transfer of a certain substance,
<i>heat</i> or <i>caloric</i>, from the first body to the
second. On this supposition, the first body <em>loses</em>
just as much heat as the other <em>gains</em>; action and
reaction are equal. But if the reaction be of a different
kind to the action we can no longer apply the axiom. If a
hot body <em>melt</em> a cold one, the latter <em>cools</em>
the former: here, then, is reaction; but so long as the
action and reaction are stated in this form, we cannot
assert any equality between them.</p>
<p>In treating of the secondary mechanical sciences, we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page191">191</a></span>
shall see further in what way we may conceive the physical
action of one body upon another, so that the same axioms
which are the basis of the science of Mechanics shall apply
to changes not at first sight manifestly mechanical.</p>
<p>The three axioms of causation which we have now stated are
the fundamental maxims of all reasoning concerning causes as
to their quantities; and it will be shown in the sequel that
these axioms form the basis of the science of Mechanics,
determining its form, extent, and certainty. We must,
however, in the first place, consider how we acquire those
conceptions upon which the axioms now established are to be
employed.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [The Axiom that <i>Reaction is equal and opposite
to Action</i>, may appear to be at variance with a maxim
concerning Cause which is commonly current; namely, that the
‘Cause precedes Effect, and Effect follows Cause.’ For it
may be said, if <i>A</i>, the Action, and <i>R</i>, the
Reaction, can be considered as mutually the cause of each
other, <i>A</i> must precede <i>R</i>, and yet must follow
it, which is impossible. But to this I reply, that in those
cases of direct Causation to which the maxim applies, the
Cause and Effect are not successive, but simultaneous. If I
press against some obstacle, the obstacle resists and
returns the pressure at the instant it is exerted, not after
any interval of time, however small. The common maxim, that
the effect follows the cause, has arisen from the practice
of considering, as examples of cause and effect, not
instantaneous forces or causes, and the instantaneous
changes which they produce; but taking, instead of this
latter, the <em>cumulative</em> effects produced in the
course of time, and compared with like results occurring
without the action of the cause. Thus, if we alter the
length of a clock-pendulum, this change produces, as its
effect, a subsequent change of rate in the clock: because
the rate is measured by the accumulated effects of the
pendulum’s gravity, before and after the change. But the
pendulum produces its mechanical effect upon the escapement,
at the moment of its contact, and each wheel upon the next,
at the moment of <em>its</em> contact. As has <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page192">192</a></span> been
said in a Review of this work, ‘The time lost in cases of
indirect physical causation is consumed in the movements
which take place among the parts of the mechanism in action,
by which the active forces so transformed into momentum are
transported over intervals of space to new points of action,
the motion of matter in such cases being regarded as a mere
carrier of force.’ (<i>Quarterly Rev.</i> No. cxxxv. p.
212.)</p>
<p>This subject I have further treated in the <i>Memoirs of the
Cambridge Philosophical Society</i>, vol. vii. part iii.]
[In this Third Edition I add this discussion.]</p>
<div class="smaller">
<p class="center"><i>Discussion of the Question:&#8212;Are Cause and Effect
successive or simultaneous?</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">I have</span> at various times laid before this Society
dissertations on the metaphysical grounds and elements of
our knowledge, and especially on the foundations of the
science of mechanics. As these speculations have not failed
to excite some attention, both here and elsewhere, I am
tempted to bring forward in the same manner some additional
disquisitions of the same kind. Indeed, the immediate
occasion of the present memoir is of itself an evidence that
such subjects are not supposed to be without their interest
for the general reader; for I am led to the views and
reasonings which I am now about to lay before the Society,
by some remarks in one of our most popular Reviews, (<i>The
Quarterly Review</i>, Article on the <i>History</i> and
<i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>, June 1841). A
writer of singular acuteness and comprehensiveness of view
has there made remarks upon the doctrines which I had
delivered in the <i>Philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences</i>, which remarks appear to me in the highest
degree instructive and philosophical. I am not, however,
going here to discuss fully the doctrines contained in this
critique. With respect to its general tendency, I will only
observe, that the author does not accept, in the form in
which I had given it, the account of the origin and ground
of necessary and universal truths. I had stated that our
knowledge is derived from Sensations and Ideas; and that
Ideas, which are the conditions of perception, such as
<i>space</i>, <i>time</i>, <i>likeness</i>, <i>cause</i>,
make universal and necessary knowledge possible; whereas, if
knowledge were derived from Sensation alone, it could not
have those characters. I have moreover <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page193">193</a></span> enumerated a
long series of Fundamental Ideas as the bases of a
corresponding series of sciences, of which sciences I have
shown also, by an historical survey, that they claim to
possess universal truths, and have their claims allowed. I
have gone further: for I have stated the Axioms which flow
from these Fundamental Ideas, and which are the logical
grounds of necessity and universality in the truths of each
science, when the science is presented in the form of a
demonstrated system. The Reviewer does not assent to this
doctrine, nor to the argument by which it is supported;
namely, that Experience cannot lead to universal truths,
except by means of a universal Idea supplied by the mind,
and infused into the particular facts which observation
ministers. He considers that the existence of universal
truths in our knowledge may be explained otherwise. He holds
that it is a sufficient account of the matter to say that we
pass from special experience to universal truth in virtue of
‘the inductive propensity&#8212;the irresistible impulse of the
mind to generalize <i>ad infinitum</i>.’ I shall not here
dwell upon very strong reasons which may be assigned, as I
conceive, for not accepting this as a full and satisfactory
explanation of the difficulty. Instead of doing so, I shall
here content myself with remarking, that even if we adopt
the Reviewer’s expressions, we must still contend that there
are <em>different forms</em> of the <em>impulse of the mind
to generalize</em>, corresponding to each of the Fundamental
Ideas of our system. These Fundamental Ideas, if they be
nothing else, must at least be accepted as a classification
of the modes of action of the Inductive Propensity,&#8212;as so
many different paths and tendencies of the Generalizing
Impulse: and the Axioms which I have stated as the express
results of the Fundamental Ideas, and as the steps by which
those Ideas make universal truths possible, are still no
less worthy of notice, if they are stated as the results of
our Generalizing Impulse; and as the steps by which that
Impulse, in its many various forms, makes universal truths
possible. The Generalizing Impulse in that operation by
which it leads us to the Axioms of Geometry, and to those of
Mechanics, takes very different courses; and these courses
may well deserve to be separately studied. And perhaps, even
if we accept this view of the philosophy of our knowledge,
no simpler or clearer way can be found of describing and
distinguishing these fundamentally different operations of
the Inductive Propensity, than by saying, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page194">194</a></span> that in the
one case it proceeds according to the Idea of Space, in
another according to the Idea of Mechanical Cause; and the
like phraseology may be employed for all the other cases.</p>
<p>This then being understood, my present object is to consider
some very remarkable, and, as appears to me, novel views of
the Idea of Cause which the Reviewer propounds. And these
may be best brought under our discussion by considering them
as an attempt to solve the question, Whether, according to
our fundamental apprehensions of the relation of Cause and
Effect, effect follows cause in the order of time, or is
simultaneous with it.</p>
<p>At first sight, this question may seem to be completely
decided by our fundamental convictions respecting cause and
effect, and by the axioms which have been propounded by
almost all writers, and have obtained universal currency
among reasoners on this subject. That the cause must precede
the effect,&#8212;that the effect must follow the cause,&#8212;are, it
might seem, self-evident truths, assumed and assented to by
all persons in all reasonings in which those notions occur.
Such a doctrine is commonly asserted in general terms, and
seems to be verified in all the applications of the idea of
cause. A heavy body produces motion by its weight; the
motion produced is subsequent in time to the pressure which
the weight exerts. In a machine, bodies push or strike each
other, and so produce a series of motions; each motion, in
this case, is the result of the motions and configurations
which have preceded it. The whole series of such motions
employs time; and this time is filled up and measured by the
series of causes and effects, the effects being, in their
turn, causes of other effects. This is the common mode of
apprehending the universal course of events, in which the
chain of causation, and the progress of time, are
contemplated as each the necessary condition and
accompaniment of the other.</p>
<p>But this, the Critic remarks, is not true in <em>direct</em>
causation. ‘If the antecedence and consequence in question
be understood as the interposition of an interval of time,
however small, between the action of the cause and the
production of the effect, we regard it as inadmissible. In
the production of motion by force, for instance, though the
effect be cumulative with continued exertion of the cause,
yet each elementary or individual action is, to our
apprehension, <i>instanter</i> accompanied with its
corresponding increment of momentum in the body moved. In
all dynamical <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page195">195</a></span> reasonings no one has ever thought of
interposing an instant of time between the action and its
resulting momentum; nor does it appear necessary.’ This is
so evident, that it appears strange it should have the air
of novelty; yet, so far as I am aware, the matter has never
before been put in the same point of view. But this being
the case, the question occurs, how it is that time
<em>seems</em> to be employed in the progress from cause to
effect? How is it that the opinion of the effect being
subsequent to the cause has generally obtained? And to this
the Critic’s answer is obvious:&#8212;it is so in cases of
indirect or of <em>cumulative</em> effect. If a ball
<i>A</i> strikes another, <i>B</i>, and puts it in motion,
and <i>B</i> strikes <i>C</i>, and puts it in motion,
<i>A</i>‘s impact may be considered as the cause, though not
the direct cause, of <i>C</i>‘s motion. Now time, namely the
time of <i>B</i>‘s motion after it is struck by <i>A</i>,
and before it strikes <i>C</i>, intervenes between
<i>A</i>‘s impact and the beginning of <i>C</i>‘s motion:
that is, between the cause and its effect. In this sense,
the effect is subsequent to the cause. Again, if a body be
put in motion by a series of impulses acting at finite
intervals of time, all in the same direction, the motion at
the end of all these intervals is the effect of all the
impulses, and exists after they have all acted. It is the
accumulated effect, and subsequent to each separate action
of the cause. But in this case, each impulse produces its
effect instantaneously, and the time is employed, not in the
transition from any cause to its effect, but in the
intervals between the action of the several causes, during
which intervals the body goes on with the velocity already
communicated to it. In each impulse, force produces motion:
and the motion goes on till a new change takes place, by the
same kind of action. The force may be said, in the language
employed by the Critic, to be transformed into momentum; and
in the successive impulses, successive portions of force are
thus transformed; while in the intervening intervals, the
force thus transformed into momentum is carried by the body
from one place to another, where a new change awaits it.
‘The cause is absorbed and transformed into effect, and
therein treasured up.’ Hence, as the Writer says, ‘The time
lost in cases of indirect physical causation is that
consumed in the movements which take place among the parts
of the mechanism set in action, by which the active forces
so transformed into mechanism are transported over intervals
of space to new points of action, the motion of matter in
such cases being <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page196">196</a></span> regarded as a mere carrier of
force’:&#8212;and when force is directly counteracted by force,
their mutual destruction must be conceived, as the Reviewer
says, to be instantaneous. We can therefore hardly resist
his conclusion, that men have been misled in assuming
sequence as a feature in the relation of cause and effect;
and we may readily assent to his suggestion, that sequence,
when observed, is to be held as a sure indication of
indirect action, accompanied with a movement of parts.</p>
<p>But yet if we turn for a moment to other kinds of causation,
we seem to be compelled at every step to recognize the truth
of the usual maxim upon this subject, that effects are
subsequent to causes. Is not poison, taken at a certain
moment, the cause of disorder and death which follow at a
<em>subsequent</em> period? Is not a man’s early prudence
often the cause of his prosperity in <em>later</em> life,
and his folly, though for a moment it may produce
gratification, <em>finally</em> the cause of his ruin? And
even in the case of mechanism, if, in a clock which goes
rightly, we alter the length of the pendulum, is not this
alteration the cause of an alteration which
<em>afterwards</em> takes place in the rate of the clock’s
going? Are not all these, and innumerable other cases,
instances in which the usual notion of the effect following
the cause is verified? and are they not irreconcileable with
the new doctrine of cause and effect being simultaneous?</p>
<p>In order to disentangle this apparent confusion, let us
first consider the case last mentioned, of a clock, in which
some alteration is made which affects the rate of going.</p>
<p>So long as the parts of the clock remain unaltered, its rate
will remain unaltered; and any part which is considered as
capable of alteration, may be considered as, if we please,
the cause of the unaltered rate, by being itself unaltered.
But we do not usually introduce the positive idea of cause,
to correspond with this negation of change. If we speak of
the rate as unaltered, we may also say that it is so because
there is <em>no cause</em> of alteration. The steady rate is
the indication of the absence of any cause of alteration;
and the rate of going measures the progress of time, in a
state of things in which causes of change are thus excluded.
If an alteration takes place in any part of the clock, once
for all, the rate is altered; but the new rate is steady as
the old rate was, and, like it, measures the uniform
progress of time. But the difference between the new rate
and the old is occasioned by <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page197">197</a></span> the difference of the
parts of the clock; and the new rate may very properly be
said to be caused by the change of the parts, and to be
subsequent to it: for it does prevail after the change, and
does not prevail before.</p>
<p>But how is this view to be reconciled with the one just
quoted from the Reviewer, and, as it appeared,
satisfactorily proved by him; according to which all
mechanical effects are simultaneous with their causes, and
not subsequent to them? We have here the two views in close
contact, and in seeming opposition.</p>
<p>In the going of a clock, the parts are in motion; and these
motions are determined by forces arising from the form and
connexion of the parts of the mechanism. Each of the forces
thus exerted at any instant produces its effect at the same
instant; and thus, so far as the term <i>cause</i> refers to
such instantaneous forces, the cause and the effect are
simultaneous. But if such instantaneous forces act at
successive intervals of time, the motion during each
interval is unaltered, and by its uniform progress measures
the progress of time. And thus the motion of the machine
consists of a series of intervals, during each of which the
motion is uniform, and measures the time; separated from
each other by a series of changes, at each of which the
change measures the instantaneous force, and is simultaneous
with it. And if, in this case, we suppose, at any point of
time, the instantaneous forces to cease, the succession of
them being terminated, from that point of time the motion
would be uniform. And since the rate of the motion in each
interval of time is determined by the instantaneous force
which last acted and by the preceding motion, the rate of
the motion in each interval of time is determined by all the
preceding instantaneous forces. Hence, when the series of
instantaneous forces stops, the rate at which the motion
goes on permanently, from that point of time, is determined
by the antecedent series of such forces, which series may be
considered as an aggregate cause; and hence it appears, that
the <em>permanent</em> effect is determined by the
<em>aggregate</em> cause; and in this sense the effect is
subsequent to the cause.</p>
<p>Thus we obtain, in this case, a solution of the difficulty
which is placed before us. The instantaneous effect or
change is simultaneous with the instantaneous force or cause
by which it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page198">198</a></span> produced. But if we consider a series
of such instantaneous forces as a single aggregate cause,
and the final condition as a permanent effect of this cause,
the effect is subsequent to the cause. In this case, the
cause is immediately succeeded by the effect. The cause acts
in time: the effect goes on in time. The times occupied by
the cause and by the effect succeed each other, the one
ending at the point of time at which the other begins. But
the time which the cause occupies is really composed of a
series of instants of uniform motion interposed between
instantaneous forces; and during the time that this series
of causes is going on, to make up the aggregate cause, a
series of effects is going on to make up the final effect.
There is a progressive cause and a progressive effect which
go on together, and occupy the same finite time; and this
simultaneous progression is composed of all the simultaneous
instantaneous steps of cause and effect. The aggregate cause
is the sum of the progression of causes; the final effect is
the last term of the progression of effects. At each step,
as the Reviewer says, cause is transformed into effect; and
it is treasured up in the results during the intermediate
intervals; and the time occupied is not the time which
intervenes between cause and effect at each step, but the
time which intervenes between these transformations.</p>
<p>I have supposed forces to act at distinct instants, and to
cease to act in the intervals between; and then, the
aggregate of such intervals to make up a finite time, during
which an aggregate force acts. But if the action of the
force be rigorously continuous, it will easily be seen that
all the consequences as to cause and effect will be the
same; the discontinuous action being merely the usual
artifice by which, in mathematical reasonings, we obtain
results respecting continuous changes. It will still be
true, that the uniform motion which takes place after a
continuous force has acted, is the effect subsequent to the
cause; while the change which takes place at any instant by
the action of the force, is the instantaneous effect
simultaneous with the cause.</p>
<p>It may be objected, that this solution does not appear
immediately to apply: for the motion of a clock is not
uniform during any portion of the time. The parts move by
intervals of varied motion and of rest; or by oscillations
backwards and forwards; and the succession of forces which
acts during any <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page199">199</a></span> oscillation, or any cycle of motion,
is repeated during the succeeding oscillation or cycle, and
so on indefinitely; and if an alteration be made in the
parts, it is not a change once for all, but recurs in its
operation in every cycle of the motion.</p>
<p>But it will be found that this circumstance does not prevent
the same explanation from being still applicable with a
slight modification. Instead of uniform motion in the
intervals of causation, we shall have to speak of <i>steady
going</i>: and instead of considering all the forces which
affect the motion as causes of change of uniform motion, we
shall have to speak of changes in the parts of the mechanism
as causes of <i>change of rate of going</i>. With this
modification, it will still be true, that any instantaneous
cause produces its instantaneous effect simultaneously,
while the permanent effect is subsequent to the change which
is its cause. The steady going of the clock is assumed as a
normal condition, in which it measures the progress of time;
and in this assumption, the notion of cause and effect is
not brought into view. But a steady rate thus denoting the
mean passage of time, a change in the rate indicates a cause
of change. The <em>change of rate</em>, as an instantaneous
<em>transition</em> from one rate to another, is
<em>simultaneous</em> with the change in the parts. But then
the <em>changed rate</em> as a continued <em>condition</em>
in which, no new change supervening, the rate again measures
the progress of time, is <em>subsequent</em> to the change
of parts, for it begins when that ends, and continues when
the progress of that has ceased.</p>
<p>If, however, this be a satisfactory solution of the
difficulty in the case of mechanism, how shall we apply the
same views to the other cases? Growth, the effect of food,
is subsequent to the act of taking food; disorder, the
effect of poison, is subsequent to the introduction of
poison into the system. Can we say that the animal would
continue unchanged if it were not to take food; and that
food is the cause of a change, namely, of growth? This is
manifestly false; for if the animal were not to take food,
it would soon perish. But the analogy of the former case, of
the clock, will enable us to avoid this perplexity. As we
assumed a steady rate of going in the clock to be the
measure of time when we considered the effect of mechanism,
so we assume a steady rate of action in the animal functions
to be the measure of the progress of time when we consider
the causes which act upon the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page200">200</a></span> development and health
of animals. Digestion, and of course nutrition, are a part
of this normal condition; they are involved in the steady
going of the animal mechanism, and we must suppose these
functions to go regularly on, in order that the animal may
preserve its character of animal. Food and digestion may be
considered as causes of the continued existence of the
animal, in the same way in which the form of the parts of a
clock is the cause of the steady going of a clock. And when
we come to consider causes of change, this kind of
causation, which produces a normal condition of things,
merely measuring the flow of time, is left out of our
account. We can conceive an uniform condition of animal
existence, the animal neither growing nor wasting. This
being taken as the normal condition, any deviation from this
condition indicates a cause, and is taken as the evidence
and measure of the cause of change. And thus, in a growing
animal, the food partly keeps the animal in continued animal
existence, and partly, and in addition to this, causes its
growth. Food, in the former view, is always circulating in
the system, and is supposed to be uniformly administered;
the cycles of nutrition being merged in the notion of
uniform existence, as the oscillations of the pendulum in a
clock are merged in the notion of uniform going; and the
elementary steps of nutrition which are, in this view,
supposed to take place at each instant, produce their
instantaneous effect, for they are requisite in the cycle of
animal processes which goes on from instant to instant. But
on the other hand, in considering growth, we compare the
state of an animal with a preceding state, and consider the
nutriment taken in the intervening time as the cause of the
change: hence this nutriment, as an aggregate, is considered
as the cause of growth of the animal; and in this view the
effect is subsequent to the cause. But yet here, as in the
case of mechanism, the progressive effect is simultaneous,
step by step, with the progressive cause. There is a series
of operations; as for instance, intussusception, digestion,
assimilation, growth: each of these is a progressive
operation; and in the progress of each operation, the steps
of the effect and the instantaneous forces are simultaneous.
But the end of one operation is the beginning of the next,
or at least in part, and hence we have time occupied by the
succession. The end of intussusception is the beginning of
digestion, the end of digestion the beginning of
assimilation, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page201">201</a></span> and so on. These aggregate effects
succeed each other; and hence growth is subsequent to the
taking of food; though each instantaneous force of animal
life, no less than of mechanism, produces an effect
simultaneous with its action. Each of these separate
operations is an aggregate operation, and occupies time; and
each aggregate effect is a condition of the action of the
cause in the next operation.</p>
<p>Again; if an animal in a permanent condition, neither waxing
nor wasting, may be taken as the normal state in which the
functions of life measure time, in order that we may
consider growth as an effect, to be referred to food as
cause; we may, for other purposes, consider, as the normal
condition, an animal waxing and then wasting, according to
the usual law of animal life: and we must take this, the
healthy progress of an animal, as our normal condition, if
we have to consider causes which produce disease. If we have
to refer the morbid condition of an animal to the influence
of poison, for example, we must consider how far the
condition deviates from what it would have been if the
poison had not been taken into the frame. The usual progress
of the animal functions including its growth, is the measure
of time; the deviation from this usual progress is the
indication of cause; and the effect of the poison is
subsequent to the cause, because the poison acts through the
cycle of the animal functions just mentioned, which occupies
time; and because the taking the poison into the system, not
any subsequent action of the animal forces in the system, is
considered as the event which we must contemplate as a
cause. To resume the analogy of the clock: the rate of the
clock is altered by altering the parts; but this alteration
itself may occupy time; as if we alter the rate of a clock
by applying a drop of acid, which gradually eats off a part
of the pendulum, the corrosion, as an aggregate effect,
occupies time; and the rates before and after the change are
separated by this time. But the application of the drop is
the cause; and thus, in this case the final effect is
subsequent to the cause, though here, as in the case of
mechanism, the instantaneous forces always produce a
simultaneous effect.</p>
<p>Thus we have in every case a <em>uniform</em> state, or a
state which is considered as uniform, or at least
<em>normal</em>; and which is taken as the indication and
measure of <em>time</em>; and we have also <em>change</em>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page202">202</a></span> which is contemplated as a deviation from uniformity,
and is taken as the indication and measure of
<em>cause</em>. The uniform state may be one which never
exists, being purely imaginary; as the case in which no
forces act; and the case in which animal functions go on
permanently, the animal neither growing nor wasting. The
normal state may also be a state in which change is
constantly taking place, as, in fact, even a state of motion
is a state of change; such states also are, in a further
sense, that of a clock going by starts, and that of an
animal constantly growing: in these cases the changes are
all merged in a wider view of uniformity, so that these are
taken as the normal states. And in all these cases,
successive changes which take place are separated by
intervals of time, measured by the normal progress; and each
change is produced by some <em>simultaneous</em>
instantaneous cause. But taking the cause in a larger sense,
we group these instantaneous causes, and perhaps omit in our
contemplation some of the intervening intervals; and thus
assign the cause to a <em>preceding</em>, and the effect to
a <em>succeeding</em> time.</p>
<p>I may observe further, as a corollary from what has been
said, that the measure of time is different, when we
consider different kinds of causation; and in each case, is
<em>homogeneous</em> with the changes which causation
effects. In the consideration of mechanical causes, we
measure time by mechanical changes;&#8212;by uniform motion, or
uniform succession of cycles of motion; by the rotation of a
wheel, or the oscillation of a pendulum. But if we have to
consider physiological changes, the progress of time is
physiologically measured;&#8212;by the normal progress of vital
operations; by the circulation, digestion or development of
the organized body; by the pulse, or by the growth. These
different measures of time give to time, so far as it is
exhibited by facts and events, a different character in the
different cases. Phenomenal time has a different nature and
essence according to the kind of the changes which we
consider, and which gives us our sole phenomenal indication
of cause.</p>
<p>I fear that I am travelling into matters too abstruse and
metaphysical for the occasion: but before I conclude, I will
present one other aspect of the subject.</p>
<p>In stating the difficulty, I referred to cases of moral as
well as physical causation; as when prudence produces
prosperity, or <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page203">203</a></span> when folly produces ruin. It may be
asked, whether we are here to apply the same
explanation;&#8212;whether we are to assume a normal condition of
human existence, in which neither prudence nor folly are
displayed, neither prosperity nor adversity
produced;&#8212;whether we are to conceive the progress of such a
state to measure the progress of time, and deviations from
it to denote causes of the kind mentioned. It may be asked
further, whether, if we do make this supposition, we can
resolve the influence of such causes as prudence or
imprudence into instantaneous acts, which produce their
effects immediately: and which occupy time only by being
separated by intervals of the inactive normal moral
condition. To this I must here reply, that the discussion of
such questions would carry me too far, and would involve
speculations not included within the acknowledged domain of
this Society, from which I therefore abstain. But I may say,
before quitting the subject, that I do not think the
suppositions above suggested are untenable; and that in
order to include moral causation under the maxims of
causation in general, we must necessarily make some such
hypothesis. The peculiarity of that kind of causation which
the will and the character exert, and which is exerted upon
the will and the character, would make this case far more
complex and difficult than those already considered; but, at
the same time, would offer us the means of explaining what
may seem harsh, in the above analogy. For instance, we
should have to assume such a maxim as this: that in moral
causation, time is not to be measured by the flow of
mechanical or physiological events;&#8212;not by the clock, or by
the pulse. Moral causation has its own clock, its own pulse,
in the progress of man’s moral being; and by this measure of
time is the relation of moral cause and effect to be
defined.</p>
<p>That in estimating moral causation, the progress of time is
necessarily estimated by moral changes, and not by
machinery,&#8212;by the progress of events, and not by the going
of the clock,&#8212;is a truth familiar as a practical maxim to
all who give their thoughts to dramatic or narrative
fictions. Who feels any thing incongruous or extravagantly
hurried in the progress of events in that great exhibition
of moral causation, the tragedy of Othello? If we were asked
what time those vast and terrible <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page204">204</a></span> and complex changes
of the being and feelings of the characters occupy, we
should say, that, measured on its own scale, the event is of
great extent;&#8212;that the transaction is of considerable
magnitude in all ways. But if, with previous critics, we
look into the progress of time by the day and the hour&#8212;what
is the measure of this history? Forty-eight hours.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Origin of our Conceptions of Force and Matter.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b3c5s1">1. <i>Force.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">When</span> the faculties of observation and
thought are developed in man, the idea of causation is
applied to those changes which we see and feel in the state
of rest and motion of bodies around us. And when our
abstract conceptions are thus formed and named, we adopt the
term <i>Force</i>, and use it to denote that property which
is the cause of motion produced, changed, or prevented. This
conception is, it would seem, mainly and primarily suggested
by our consciousness of the exertions by which we put bodies
in motion. The Latin and Greek words for <i>Force</i>,
Vis, Ϝὶς, were probably, like all abstract
terms, derived at first from some sensible object. The
original meaning of the Greek word was a <i>muscle</i> or
<i>tendon</i>. Its first application as an abstract term is
accordingly to muscular force:</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">Δεύτερος αὖτ’ Αἴας πολὺ μείζονα λᾶαν ἀείρας</span><br/>

   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"> Then Ajax a far heavier stone upheaved,</span><br/>

    <span class="i0">Upon the mass, dismist it.</span><br/>
    </div>
</div></div>
<p>The property by which bodies affect each other’s motions,
was naturally likened to that energy which we exert upon
them with similar effect: and thus the labouring horse, the
rushing torrent, the descending weight, the elastic bow,
were said to exert force. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page206">206</a></span> Homer<a id="fnanchor8-3" href="#note8-3"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a> speaks of the
<i>force</i> of the river, Ϝὶς ποταμοῖο; and
Hesiod<a id="fnanchor9-3" href="#note9-3"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> of the <i>force</i> of the north wind, Ϝὶς
ἀνέμου βορέαο.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-3" href="#fnanchor8-3">8</a></span> <i>Il.</i> xxi.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-3" href="#fnanchor9-3">9</a></span> <i>Op. et D.</i></div>
<p>Thus man’s general notion of force was probably first
suggested by his muscular exertions, that is, by an act
depending upon that muscular sense, to which, as we have
already seen, the perception of space is mainly due. And
this being the case, it will be easily understood that the
<em>Direction</em> of the force thus exerted is perceived by
the muscular sense, at the same time that the force itself
is perceived; and that the direction of any other force is
understood by comparison with force which man must exert to
produce the same effect, in the same manner as force itself
is so understood.</p>
<p>This abstract notion of Force long remained in a very vague
and obscure condition, as may be seen by referring to the
History for the failures of attempts at a science of force
and motion, made by the ancients and their commentators in
the middle ages. By degrees, in modern times, we see the
scientific faculty revive. The conception of Force becomes
so far distinct and precise that it can be reasoned upon in
a consistent manner, with demonstrated consequences; and a
genuine science of Mechanics comes into existence. The
foundations of this science are to be found in the Axioms
concerning causation which we have already stated; these
axioms being interpreted and fixed in their application by a
constant reference to observed facts, as we shall show. But
we must, in the first place, consider further those primary
processes of observation by which we acquire the first
materials of thought on such subjects.</p>
<p id="b3c5s2">2. <i>Matter.</i>&#8212;The conception of Force, as we have said,
arises with our consciousness of our own muscular exertions.
But we cannot imagine such exertions without also imagining
some bodily substance against which they are exercised. If
we press, we press something: if we thrust or throw, there
must be something <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page207">207</a></span> to resist the thrust or to receive
the impulse. Without body, muscular force cannot be exerted,
and force in general is not conceivable.</p>
<p>Thus Force cannot exist without <i>Body</i> on which it
acts. The two conceptions, Force and Matter, are co-existent
and correlative. Force implies resistance; and the force is
effective only when the resistance is called into play. If
we grasp a stone, we have no hold of it till the closing of
the hand is resisted by the solid texture of the stone. If
we push open a gate, we must surmount the opposition which
it exerts while turning on its hinges. However slight the
resistance be, there must be some resistance, or there would
be no force. If we imagine a state of things in which
objects do not resist our touch, they must also cease to be
influenced by our strength. Such a state of things we
sometimes imagine in our dreams; and such are the poetical
pictures of the regions inhabited by disembodied spirits. In
these, the figures which appear are conspicuous to the eye,
but impalpable like shadow or smoke; and as they do not
resist the corporeal impressions, so neither do they obey
them. The spectator tries in vain to strike or to grasp
them.</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">

   </div><div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">He grasps her form, and clutches but the shade.</span><br/>
   </div>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">Such may be the circumstances of the unreal world of dreams,
or of poetical fancies approaching to dreams: for in these
worlds our imaginary perceptions are bound by no rigid
conditions of force and reaction. In <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page208">208</a></span> such cases, the
mind casts off the empire of the idea of cause, as it casts
off even the still more familiar sway of the ideas of space
and time. But the character of the material world in which
we live when awake is, that we have at every instant and at
every place, force operating on matter and matter resisting
force.</p>
<p id="b3c5s3">3. <i>Solidity.</i>&#8212;From our consciousness of muscular
exertion, we derive, as we have seen, the conception of
force, and with that also the conception of matter. We have
already shown, in a former chapter, that the same part of
our frame, the muscular system, is the organ by which we
perceive extension and the relations of space. Thus the same
organ gives us the perception of body as resisting force,
and as occupying space; and by combining these conditions we
have the conception of <em>solid</em> extended bodies. In
reality, this resistance is inevitably presented to our
notice in the very facts from which we collect the notion of
extension. For the action of the hand and arm by which we
follow the forms of objects, implies that we apply our
fingers to their surface; and we are stopped there by the
resistance which the body offers. This resistance is
precisely that which is requisite in order to make us
conscious of cur muscular effort<a id="fnanchor10-3" href="#note10-3"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>. Neither touch, nor
any other mere passive sensation, could produce the
perception of extent, as we have already urged: nor could
the muscular sense lead to such a perception, except the
extension of the muscles were felt to be resisted. And thus
the perception of resistance enters the mind along with the
perception of extended bodies. All the objects with which we
have to do are not only extended but solid.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-3" href="#fnanchor10-3">10</a></span> Brown’s <i>Lectures</i>, i. 466.</div>
<p>This sense of the term <i>solidity</i>, (the general
property of all matter,) is different to that in which we
oppose <i>solidity</i> to <i>fluidity</i>. We may avoid
ambiguity by opposing <i>rigid</i> to <i>fluid</i> bodies.
By solid bodies, as we now speak of them, we mean only such
as resist the pressure which we exert, so long as their
parts continue in their places. By fluid bodies, we mean
those <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page209">209</a></span> whose parts are, by a slight pressure, removed
out of their places. A drop of water ceases to prevent the
contact of our two hands, not by ceasing to have solidity in
this sense, but by being thrust out of the way. If it could
remain in its place, it could not cease to exercise its
resistance to our pressure, except by ceasing to be matter
altogether.</p>
<p>The perception of solidity, like the perception of
extension, implies an act of the mind, as well as an
impression of the senses: as the perception of extension
implies the idea of space, so the perception of solidity
implies the idea of action and reaction. That an Idea is
involved in our knowledge on this subject, appears, as in
other instances, from this consideration, that the
convictions of persons, even of those who allow of no ground
of knowledge but experience, do in fact go far beyond the
possible limits of experience. Thus Locke says<a id="fnanchor11-3" href="#note11-3"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a>, that
‘the bodies which we daily handle hinder by an
<em>insurmountable</em> force the approach of the parts of
our hands that press them.’ Now it is manifest that our
observation can never go to this length. By our senses we
can only perceive that bodies resist the greatest actual
forces that we exert upon them. But our conception of force
carries us further: and since, so long as the body is there
to receive the action of the force, it must suffer the whole
of that action, and must react as much as it suffers: it is
therefore true, that so long as the body remains there, the
force which is exerted upon it can never surmount the
resistance which the body exercises. And thus this doctrine,
that bodies resist the intrusion of other bodies by an
insurmountable force, is, in fact, a consequence of the
axiom that the reaction is always equal to the action.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-3" href="#fnanchor11-3">11</a></span> <i>Essay</i>, b. ii. c. 4.</div>
<p id="b3c5s4">4. <i>Inertia.</i>&#8212;But this principle of the equality of
action and reaction appears also in another way. Not only
when we exert force upon bodies at rest, but when, by our
exertions, we put them in motion, they react. If we set a
large stone in motion, the stone <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page210">210</a></span> resists; for the
operation requires an effort. By increasing the effort, we
can increase the effect, that is, the motion produced; but
the resistance still remains. And the greater the stone
moved, the greater is the effort requisite to move it. There
is, in every case, a resistance to motion, which shows
itself, not in preventing the motion, but in a reciprocal
force, exerted backwards upon the agent by which the motion
is produced. And this resistance resides in each portion of
matter, for it is increased as we add one portion of matter
to another. We can push a light boat rapidly through the
water; but we may go on increasing its freight, till we are
barely able to stir it. This property of matter, then, by
which it resists the reception of motion, or rather by which
it reacts and requires an adequate force in order that any
motion may result, is called its inertness, or
<i>inertia</i>. That matter has such a property, is a
conviction flowing from that idea of a reaction equal and
opposite to the action, which the conception of all force
involves. By what laws this inertia depends on the
magnitude, form, and material of the body, must be the
subject of our consideration hereafter. But that matter has
this inertia, in virtue of which, as the matter is greater,
the velocity which the same effort can communicate to it is
less, is a principle inseparable from the notion of matter
itself.</p>
<p>Hermann says that Kepler first introduced this ‘most
significant’ <i>inertia</i>. Whether it is to be found in
earlier writers I know not; Kepler certainly does use it
familiarly in those attempts to assign physical reasons for
the motions of the planets which were among the main
occasions of the discovery of the true laws of mechanics. He
assumes the slowness of the motions of the planets to
increase, (other causes remaining the same,) as the inertia
increases; and though, even in this assumption, there is an
errour involved, (if we adopt that interpretation of the
term <i>inertia</i> to which subsequent researches led,) the
introduction of such a word was one step in determining and
expressing those laws of motion which depend on the
fundamental principle of the equality of action and
reaction. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page211">211</a></span></p>
<p id="b3c5s5">5. We have thus seen, I trust in a satisfactory manner, the
origin of our conceptions of Force, Matter, Solidity, and
Inertness. It has appeared that the organ by which we obtain
such conceptions is that very muscular frame, which is the
main instrument of our perceptions of space; but that,
besides bodily sensations, these ideal conceptions, like all
the others which we have hitherto considered, involve also
an habitual activity of the mind, giving to our sensations a
meaning which they could not otherwise possess. And among
the ideas thus brought into play, is an idea of action with
an equal and opposite reaction, which forms a foundation for
universal truths to be hereafter established respecting the
conceptions thus obtained.</p>
<p>We must now endeavour to trace in what manner these
fundamental principles and conceptions are unfolded by means
of observation and reasoning, till they become an extensive
yet indisputable science.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Establishment of the Principles of Statics.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b3c6s1">1. <i>Object of the Chapter.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">In</span> the present and the
succeeding chapters we have to show how the general axioms
of Causation enable us to construct the science of
Mechanics. We have to consider these axioms as moulding
themselves, in the first place, into certain fundamental
mechanical principles, which are of evident and necessary
truth in virtue of their dependence upon the general axioms
of Causation; and thus as forming a foundation for the whole
structure of the science;&#8212;a system of truths no less
necessary than the fundamental principles, because derived
from these by rigorous demonstration.</p>
<p>This account of the construction of the science of
Mechanics, however generally treated, cannot be otherwise
than technical in its details, and will probably be
imperfectly understood by any one not acquainted with
Mechanics as a mathematical science.</p>
<p>I cannot omit this portion of my survey without rendering my
work incomplete; but I may remark that the main purpose of
it is to prove, in a more particular manner, what I have
already declared in general, that there are, in Mechanics no
less than in Geometry, fundamental principles of axiomatic
evidence and necessity;&#8212;that these principles derive their
axiomatic character from the Idea which they involve,
namely, the Idea of Cause;&#8212;and that through the combination
of principles of this kind, the whole science of Mechanics,
including its most complex and remote results, exists as a
body of solid and universal truths. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page213">213</a></span></p>
<p id="b3c6s2">2. <i>Statics and Dynamics.</i>&#8212;We must first turn our
attention to a technical distinction of Mechanics into two
portions, according as the forces about which we reason
produce rest, or motion; the former portion is termed
<i>Statics</i>, the latter <i>Dynamics</i>. If a stone fall,
or a weight put a machine in motion, the problem belongs to
Dynamics; but if the stone rest upon the ground, or a weight
be merely supported by a machine, without being raised
higher, the question is one of Statics.</p>
<p id="b3c6s3">3. <i>Equilibrium.</i>&#8212;In Statics, forces <i>balance</i>
each other, or keep each other <i>in equilibrium</i>. And
forces which directly balance each other, or keep each other
in equilibrium, are necessarily and manifestly equal. If we
see two boys pull at two ends of a rope so that neither of
them in the smallest degree prevails over the other, we have
a case in which two forces are in equilibrium. The two
forces are evidently equal, and are a statical
exemplification of action and reaction, such as are spoken
of in the third axiom concerning causes. Now the same
exemplification occurs in every case of equilibrium. No
point or body can be kept at rest except in virtue of
opposing forces acting upon it; and these forces must always
be equal in their opposite effect. When a stone lies on the
floor, the weight of the stone downwards is opposed and
balanced by an equal pressure of the floor upwards. If the
stone rests on a slope, its tendency to slide is
counteracted by some equal and opposite force, arising, it
may be, from the resistance which the sloping ground opposes
to any motion along its surface. Every case of rest is a
case of equilibrium: every case of equilibrium is a case of
equal and opposite forces.</p>
<p>The most complex frame-work on which weights are supported,
as the roof of a building, or the cordage of a machine, are
still examples of equilibrium. In such cases we may have
many forces all combining to balance each other; and the
equilibrium will depend on various conditions of direction
and magnitude among the forces. And in order to understand
what are these conditions, we must ask, in the first place,
what <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page214">214</a></span> we understand by the magnitude of such
forces;&#8212;what is the measure of statical forces.</p>
<p id="b3c6s4">4. <i>Measure of Statical Forces.</i>&#8212;At first we might
expect, perhaps, that since statical forces come under the
general notion of Cause, the mode of measuring them would be
derived from the second axiom of Causation, that causes are
measured by their effects. But we find that the application
of this axiom is controlled by the limitation which we
noticed, after stating that axiom; namely, the condition
that the causes shall be capable of addition. Further, as we
have seen, a statical force produces no other effect than
this, that it balances some other statical force; and hence
the measure of statical forces is necessarily dependent upon
their balancing, that is, upon the equality of action and
reaction.</p>
<p>That <em>statical forces are capable of addition</em> is
involved in our conception of such forces. When two men pull
at a rope in the same direction, the forces which they exert
are added together. When two heavy bodies are put into a
basket suspended by a string, their weights are added, and
the sum is supported by the string.</p>
<p>Combining these considerations, it will appear that the
measure of statical forces is necessarily given at once by
the fundamental principle of the equality of action and
reaction. Since two opposite forces which balance each other
are equal, each force is measured by that which it balances;
and since forces are capable of addition, a force of any
magnitude is measured by adding together a proper number of
such equal forces. Thus a heavy body which, appended to some
certain elastic branch of a tree, would bend it down through
one inch, may be taken as a unit of weight. Then if we
remove this first body, and find a second heavy body which
will also bend the branch through the same space, this is
also a unit of weight; and in like manner we might go on to
a third and a fourth equal body; and adding together the
two, or the three, or the four heavy bodies, we have a force
twice, or three times, or four times the unit of weight. And
with <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page215">215</a></span> such a collection of heavy bodies, or
<i>weights</i>, we can readily measure all other forces; for
the same principle of the equality of action and reaction
leads at once to this maxim, that any statical force is
measured by the weight which it would support.</p>
<p>As has been said, it might at first have been supposed that
we should have to apply, in this case, the axiom that causes
are measured by their effects in another manner; that thus,
if that body were a unit of weight which bent the bough of a
tree through one inch, <em>that</em> body would be
<em>two</em> units which bent it through <em>two</em>
inches, and so on. But, as we have already stated, the
measures of weight must be subject to this condition, that
they are susceptible of being added: and therefore we cannot
take the deflexion of the bough for our measure, till we
have ascertained, that which experience alone can teach us,
that under the burden of two equal weights, the deflexion
will be twice as great as it is with one weight, which is
not true, or at least is neither obviously nor necessarily
true. In this, as in all other cases, although causes must
be measured by their effects, we learn from experience only
how the effects are to be interpreted, so as to give a true
and consistent measure.</p>
<p>With regard, however, to the measure of statical force, and
of weight, no difficulty really occurred to philosophers
from the time when they first began to speculate on such
subjects; for it was easily seen that if we take any uniform
material, as wood, or stone, or iron, portions of this which
are geometrically equal, must also be equal in statical
effect; since this was implied in the very hypothesis of a
uniform material And a body ten times as large as another of
the same substance, will be of ten times the weight. But
before men could establish by reasoning the conditions under
which weights would be in equilibrium, some other principles
were needed in addition to the mere measure of forces. The
principles introduced for this purpose still resulted from
the conception of equal action and reaction; but it required
no small clearness of thought to select them rightly, and to
employ them <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page216">216</a></span> successfully. This, however, was done, to
a certain extent, by the Greeks; and the treatise of
Archimedes <i>On the Center of Gravity</i>, is founded on
principles which may still be considered as the genuine
basis of statical reasoning. I shall make a few remarks on
the most important principle among those which Archimedes
thus employs.</p>
<p id="b3c6s5">5. <i>The Center of Gravity.</i>&#8212;The most important of the
principles which enter into the demonstration of Archimedes
is this: that “Every body has a center of gravity;” meaning
by the center of gravity, a point at which the whole matter
of the body may be supposed to be collected, to all intents
and purposes of statical reasoning. This principle has been
put in various forms by succeeding writers: for instance, it
has been thought sufficient to assume a case much simpler
than the general one; and to assert that two <em>equal</em>
bodies have their center of gravity in the point midway
between them. It is to be observed, that this assertion not
only implies that the two bodies will <i>balance</i> upon a
support placed at that midway point, but also, that they
will exercise, upon such a support, a <i>pressure equal to
their sum</i>; for this point being the center of gravity,
the whole matter of the two bodies may be conceived to be
collected there, and therefore the whole weight will press
there. And thus the principle in question amounts to this,
that <em>when two equal heavy bodies are supported on the
middle point between them, the pressure upon the support is
equal to the sum of the weights of the bodies</em>.</p>
<p>A clear understanding of the nature and grounds of this
principle is of great consequence: for in it we have the
foundation of a large portion of the science of Mechanics.
And if this principle can be shown to be necessarily true,
in virtue of our Fundamental Ideas, we can hardly doubt that
there exist many other truths of the same kind, and that no
sound view of the evidence and extent of human knowledge can
be obtained, so long as we mistake the nature of these, its
first principles. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page217">217</a></span></p>
<p>The above principle, that the pressure on the support is
equal to the sum of the bodies supported, is often stated as
an axiom in the outset of books on Mechanics. And this
appears to be the true place and character of this
principle, in accordance with the reasonings which we have
already urged. The axiom depends upon our conception of
action and reaction. That the two weights are supported,
implies that the supporting force must be equal to the force
or weight supported.</p>
<p>In order further to show the foundation of this principle,
we may ask the question:&#8212;If it be not an axiom, deriving
its truth from the fundamental conception of equal action
and reaction, which equilibrium always implies, what is the
origin of its certainty? The principle is never for an
instant denied or questioned: it is taken for granted, even
before it is stated. No one will doubt that it is not only
true, but true with the same rigour and universality as the
axioms of Geometry. Will it be said, that it is borrowed
from experience? Experience could never prove a principle to
be universally and rigorously true. Moreover, when from
experience we prove a proposition to possess great exactness
and generality, we approach by degrees to this proof: the
conviction becomes stronger, the truth more secure, as we
accumulate trials. But nothing of this kind is the case in
the instance before us. There is no gradation from less to
greater certainty;&#8212;no hesitation which precedes confidence.
From the first, we know that the axiom is exactly and
certainly true. In order to be convinced of it, we do not
require many trials, but merely a clear understanding of the
assertion itself.</p>
<p>But in fact, not only are trials not necessary to the proof,
but they do not strengthen it. Probably no one ever made a
trial for the purpose of showing that the pressure upon the
support is equal to the sum of the two weights. Certainly no
person with clear mechanical conceptions ever wanted such a
trial to convince him of the truth; or thought the truth
clearer after the trial had been made. If to such a person,
an <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page218">218</a></span> experiment were shown which seemed to contradict
the principle, his conclusion would be, not that the
principle was doubtful, but that the apparatus was out of
order. Nothing can be less like collecting truth from
experience than this.</p>
<p>We maintain, then, that this equality of mechanical action
and reaction, is one of the principles which do not flow
from, but regulate our experience. To this principle, the
facts which we observe must conform; and we cannot help
interpreting them in such a manner that they shall be
exemplifications of the principle. A mechanical pressure not
accompanied by an equal and opposite pressure, can no more
be given by experience, than two unequal right angles. With
the supposition of such inequalities, space ceases to be
space, force ceases to be force, matter ceases to be matter.
And this equality of action and reaction, considered in the
case in which two bodies are connected so as to act on a
single support, leads to the axiom which we have stated
above, and which is one of the main foundations of the
science of Mechanics.</p>
<p>[2d ed.] [To the doctrine that mechanical principles, such
as the one here under consideration (that the pressure on
the point of support is equal to the sum of the weights),
are derived from our Ideas, and do not flow from but
regulate our experience, objections are naturally made by
those who assert all our knowledge to be derived from
experience. How, they ask, can we know the properties of
pressures, levers and the like, except from experience? What
but experience can possibly inform us that a force applied
transversely to a lever will have any tendency to turn the
lever on its center? This cannot be, except we suppose in
the lever tenacity, rigidity and the like, which are
qualities known only by experience. And it is obvious that
this line of argument might be carried on through the whole
subject.</p>
<p>My answer to this objection is a remark of the same kind as
one which I have made respecting the Ideas of Space, Time,
and Number, in the last Book. The mind, in apprehending
events as causes <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page219">219</a></span> and effects, is governed by Laws of
its own Activity; and these Laws govern the results of the
mind’s action; and make these results conform to the Axioms
of Causation. But this activity of the mind is awakened and
developed by being exercised; and in dealing with the
examples of cause and effect here spoken of, (namely,
pressure and resistance, force and motion,) the mind’s
activity is necessarily governed also by the bodily powers
of perception and action. We are human beings only in so far
as we have existed in space and time; and of our human
faculties, developed by our existence in space and time,
space and time are necessary conditions. In like manner, we
are human beings only in so far as we have bodies, and
bodily organs; and our bodies necessarily imply material
objects external to us. And hence our human faculties,
developed by our bodily existence in a material world, have
the conditions of matter for their necessary Laws. I have
already said (<a href="#b3c5s1">chap. v.</a>) that our conception of Force arises
with our consciousness of our own muscular exertions;&#8212;that
Force cannot be conceived without Resistance to exercise
itself upon;&#8212;and that this resistance is supplied by
Matter. And thus the conception of Matter, and of the most
general modes in which Matter receives, resists, and
transmits force, are parts of our constitution which, though
awakened and unfolded by our being in a material world, are
not distinguishable from the original structure of the mind.
I do not ascribe to the mind <em>innate</em> Ideas&#8212;Ideas
which it would have, even if it had no intercourse with the
world of space, time, and matter; because we cannot imagine
a mind in such a state. But I attempt to point out and
classify those Conditions of all Experience, to which the
intercourse of all minds with the material world has
necessarily given rise in all. Truths <em>thus</em>
necessarily acquired in the course of all experience, cannot
be said to be learnt <em>from experience</em>, in the same
sense in which particular facts, at definite times, are
learnt from experience&#8212;learnt by some persons and not by
others&#8212;learnt with more or less of certainty. These latter
<em>special truths of</em> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page220">220</a></span> <em>experience</em> will be
very important subjects of our consideration; but our whole
chance of discussing them with any profit depends upon our
keeping them distinct from the <em>necessary and universal
conditions of experience</em>. Here, as everywhere, we must
keep in view the fundamental antithesis of Ideas and Facts.]</p>
<p id="b3c6s6">6. <i>Oblique Forces.</i>&#8212;By the aid of the above axiom and
a few others, the Greeks made some progress in the science
of Statics. But after a short advance, they arrived at
another difficulty, that of Oblique Forces, which they never
overcame; and which no mathematician mastered till modern
times. The unpublished manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci,
written in the fifteenth century, and the works of Stevinus
and Galileo, in the sixteenth, are the places in which we
find the first solid grounds of reasoning on the subject of
forces acting obliquely to each other. And from that period,
mathematicians, having thus become possessed of all the
mechanical principles which are requisite in problems
respecting equilibrium, soon framed a complete science of
Statics. Succeeding writers presented this science in forms
variously modified; for it was found, in Mechanics as in
Geometry, that various propositions might be taken as the
starting points; and that the collection of truths which it
was the mechanician’s business to include in his course,
might thus be traversed by various routes, each path
offering a series of satisfactory demonstrations. The
fundamental conceptions of force and resistance, like those
of space and number, could be contemplated under different
aspects, each of which might be made the basis of axioms, or
of principles employed as axioms. Hence the grounds of the
truth of Statics may be stated in various ways; and it would
be a task of some length to examine all these completely,
and to trace them to their Fundamental Ideas. This I shall
not undertake here to do; but the philosophical importance
of the subject makes it proper to offer a few remarks on
some of the main principles involved in the different modes
of presenting Statics as a rigorously demonstrated science. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page221">221</a></span></p>
<p id="b3c6s7">7. <i>A Force may be supposed to act at any Point of its
Direction.</i>&#8212;It has been stated in the history of
Mechanics<a id="fnanchor12-3" href="#note12-3"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>, that Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo obtained
the true measure of the effect of oblique forces, by
reasonings which were, in substance, the same. The principle
of these reasonings is that expressed at the head of this
paragraph; and when we have a little accustomed ourselves to
contemplate our conceptions of force, and its action on
matter, in an abstract manner, we shall have no difficulty
in assenting to the principle in this general form. But it
may, perhaps, be more obvious at first in a special case.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-3" href="#fnanchor12-3">12</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vi. c. i. sect. 2.</div>
<p>If we suppose a wheel, moveable about its axis, and carrying
with it in its motion a weight, (as, for example, one of the
wheels by means of which the large bells of a church are
rung,) this weight may be supported by means of a rope (not
passing along the circumference of the wheel, as is usual in
the case of bells,) but fastened to one of the spokes of the
wheel. Now the principle which is enunciated above asserts,
that if the rope pass in a straight line across several of
the spokes of the wheel, it makes no difference in the
mechanical effect of the force applied, for the purpose of
putting the bell in motion, to <em>which</em> of these
spokes the rope is <em>fastened</em>. In each case, the
fastening of the rope to the wheel merely serves to enable
the force to produce motion about the center; and so long as
the force acts in the same line, the effect is the same, at
whatever point of the rope the line of action finishes.</p>
<p>This axiom very readily aids us in estimating the effect of
oblique forces. For when a force acts on one of the arms of
a lever at any oblique angle, we suppose another arm
projecting from the center of motion, like another spoke of
the same wheel, so situated that it is perpendicular to the
force. This arm we may, with Leonardo, call the <i>virtual
lever</i>; for, by the axiom, we may suppose the force to
act where the line of its direction meets this arm; and thus
we reduce the case <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page222">222</a></span> to that in which the force acts
perpendicularly on the arm.</p>
<p>The ground of this axiom is, that matter, in Statics, is
necessarily conceived as <em>transmitting</em> force. That
force can be transmitted from one place to another, by means
of matter;&#8212;that we can push with a rod, pull with a
rope,&#8212;are suppositions implied in our conceptions of force
and matter. Matter is, as we have said, that which receives
the impression of force, and the modes just mentioned, are
the simplest ways in which that impression operates. And
since, in any of these cases, the force might be resisted by
a reaction equal to the force itself, the reaction in each
case would be equal, and, therefore, the action in each case
is necessarily equal; and thus the forces must be
transmitted, from one point to another, without increase or
diminution.</p>
<p>This property of matter, of transmitting the action of
force, is of various kinds. We have the coherence of a rope
which enables us to pull, and the rigidity of a staff, which
enables us to push with it in the direction of its length;
and again, the same staff has a rigidity of another kind, in
virtue of which we can use it as a lever; that is, a
rigidity to resist flexure, and to transmit the force which
turns a body round a fulcrum. There is, further, the
rigidity by which a solid body resists <em>twisting</em>. Of
these kinds of rigidity, the first is that to which our
axiom refers; but in order to complete the list of the
elementary principles of Statics, we ought also to lay down
axioms respecting the other kinds of rigidity<a id="fnanchor13-3" href="#note13-3"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>. These,
however, I shall not here state, as they do not involve any
new principle. Like the one just considered, they form part
of our fundamental conception of matter; they are not the
results of any experience, but are the hypotheses to which
we are irresistibly led, when we would liberate our
reasonings concerning force and matter from a dependence on
the special results of experience. We cannot even <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page223">223</a></span>
conceive (that is, if we have any clear mechanical
conceptions at all) the force exerted by the point of a
staff and resisting the force which we steadily impress on
the head of it, to be different from the impressed force.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-3" href="#fnanchor13-3">13</a></span> Such axioms are given in a little work (<i>The
Mechanical Euclid</i>) which I published on the Elements of
Mechanics.</div>
<p id="b3c6s8">8. <i>Forces may have equivalent Forces substituted for
them. The Parallelogram of Forces.</i>&#8212;It has already been
observed, that in order to prove the doctrines of Statics,
we may take various principles as our starting points, and
may still find a course of demonstration by which the
leading propositions belonging to the subject may be
established. Thus, instead of beginning our reasonings, as
in the last section we supposed them to commence, with the
case in which forces act upon different points of the same
body in the same line of force, and counteract each other in
virtue of the intervening matter by which the effect of
force is transferred from one point to another; we may
suppose different forces to act at the same point, and may
thus commence our reasonings with a case in which we have to
contemplate force, without having to take into our account
the resistance or rigidity of matter. Two statical forces,
thus acting at a mathematical point, are equivalent, in all
respects, to some single force acting at the same point; and
would be kept in equilibrium by a force equal and opposite
to that single force. And the rule by which the single force
is derived from the two, is commonly termed <i>the
parallelogram of forces</i>; the proposition being
this,&#8212;That if the two forces be represented in magnitude
and direction by the two sides of a parallelogram, the
resulting force will be represented in the same manner by
the diagonal of the parallelogram. This proposition has very
frequently been made, by modern writers, the commencement of
the science of Mechanics: a position for which, by its
simplicity, it is well suited; although, in order to deduce
from it the other elementary propositions of the science,
as, for instance, those respecting the lever, we require the
axiom stated in the last section.</p>
<p id="b3c6s9">9. <i>The Parallelogram of Forces is a necessary
Truth.</i>&#8212;In the series of discussions in which we are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page224">224</a></span> here engaged, our main business is to ascertain the
nature and grounds of the certainty of scientific truths. We
have, therefore, to ask whether this proposition, the
parallelogram of forces, be a necessary truth; and if so, on
what grounds its necessity ultimately rests. We shall find
that this, like the other fundamental doctrines of Statics,
justly claim a demonstrative certainty. Daniel Bernoulli, in
1726, gave the first proof of this important proposition on
pure statical principles; and thus, as he says<a id="fnanchor14-3" href="#note14-3"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>,
‘proved that statical theorems are not less necessarily true
than geometrical are.’ If we examine this proof of
Bernoulli, in order to discover what are the principles on
which it rests, we shall find that the reasoning employs in
its progress such axioms as this;&#8212;That if from forces which
are in equilibrium at a point be taken away other forces
which are in equilibrium at the same point, the remainder
will be in equilibrium; and generally;&#8212;That if forces can
be resolved into other equivalent forces, these may be
separated, grouped, and recombined, in any new manner, and
the result will still be identical with what it was at
first. Thus in Bernoulli’s proof, the two forces to be
compounded are represented by <span class="sc">p</span> and <span class="sc">q; p</span> is resolved into
two other forces, <span class="sc">x</span> and <span class="sc">u</span>; and <span class="sc">q</span> into two others, <span class="sc">y</span> and <span class="sc">v</span>,
under certain conditions. It is then assumed that these
forces may be grouped into the pairs <span class="sc">x, y</span>, and <span class="sc">u, v</span>: and
when it has been shown that <span class="sc">x</span> and <span class="sc">y</span> are in equilibrium, they
may, by what has been said, be removed, and the forces, <span class="sc">p,
q</span>, are equivalent to <span class="sc">u, v</span>; which, being in the same
direction by the course of the construction, have a result
equal to their sum.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-3" href="#fnanchor14-3">14</a></span> <i>Comm. Petrop.</i> vol. i.</div>
<p>It is clear that the principles here assumed are genuine
axioms, depending upon our conception of the nature of
equivalence of forces, and upon their being capable of
addition and composition. If the forces, <span class="sc">p, q</span>, be
<em>equivalent</em> to forces <span class="sc">x, u, y, v</span>, they are
equivalent to these forces added and compounded in any
order; just as a geometrical figure is, by our conception of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page225">225</a></span> space, equivalent to its parts added together in any
order. The apprehension of forces as having magnitude, as
made up of parts, as capable of composition, leads to such
axioms in Statics, in the same manner as the like
apprehension of space leads to the axioms of Geometry. And
thus the truths of Statics, resting upon such foundations,
are independent of experience in the same manner in which
geometrical truths are so.</p>
<p>The proof of the parallelogram of forces thus given by
Daniel Bernoulli, as it was the first, is also one of the
most simple proofs of that proposition which have been
devised up to the present day. Many other demonstrations,
however, have been given of the same proposition. Jacobi, a
German mathematician, has collected and examined eighteen of
these<a id="fnanchor15-3" href="#note15-3"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>. They all depend either upon such principles as
have just been stated; That forces may in every way be
replaced by those which are equivalent to them;&#8212;or else
upon those previously stated, the doctrine of the lever, and
the transfer of a force from one point to another of its
direction. In either case, they are necessary results of our
statical conceptions, independent of any observed laws of
motion, and indeed, of the conception of actual motion
altogether.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-3" href="#fnanchor15-3">15</a></span> These are by the following mathematicians; D.
Bernoulli (1726); Lambert (1771); Scarella (1756); Venini
(1764); Araldi (1806); Wachter (1815); Kaestner; Marini;
Eytelwein; Salimbeni; Duchayla; two different proofs by
Foncenex (1760); three by D’Alembert; and those of Laplace
and M. Poisson.</div>
<p>There is another class of alleged proofs of the
parallelogram of forces, which involve the consideration of
the motion produced by the forces. But such reasonings are,
in fact, altogether irrelevant to the subject of Statics. In
that science, forces are not measured by the motion which
they produce, but by the forces which they will balance, as
we have already seen. The combination of two forces employed
in producing motion in the same body, either simultaneously
or successively, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page226">226</a></span> belongs to that part of Mechanics
which has motion for its subject, and is to be considered in
treating of the laws of motion. The composition of motion,
(as when a man moves in a ship while the ship moves through
the water,) has constantly been confounded with the
composition of force. But though it has been done by very
eminent mathematicians, it is quite necessary for us to keep
the two subjects distinct, in order to see the real nature
of the evidence of truth in either case. The conditions of
equilibrium of two forces on a lever, or of three forces at
a point, can be established without any reference whatever
to any motions which the forces might, under <em>other</em>
circumstances, produce. And because this can be done, to do
so is the only scientific procedure. To prove such
propositions by any other course, would be to support truth
by extraneous and inconclusive reasons; which would be
foreign to our purpose, since we seek not only knowledge,
but the grounds of our knowledge.</p>
<p id="b3c6s10">10. <i>The Center of gravity seeks the lowest
place.</i>&#8212;The principles which we have already mentioned
afford a sufficient basis for the science of Statics in its
most extensive and varied applications; and the conditions
of equilibrium of the most complex combinations of machinery
may be deduced from these principles with a rigour not
inferior to that of geometry. But in some of the more
complex cases, the results of long trains of reasoning may
be foreseen, in virtue of certain maxims which appear to us
self-evident, although it may not be easy to trace the exact
dependence of these maxims upon our fundamental conceptions
of force and matter. Of this nature is the maxim now
stated;&#8212;That in any combination of matter any how
supported, the Center of Gravity will descend into the
lowest position which the connexion of the parts allows it
to assume by descending. It is easily seen that this maxim
carries to a much greater extent the principle which the
Greek mathematicians assumed, that every body has a Center
of Gravity, that is, a point in which, if the whole matter
of the body be collected, the effect will remain unchanged.
For the Greeks asserted this of a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page227">227</a></span> single rigid mass
only; whereas, in the maxim now under our notice, it is
asserted of any masses, connected by strings, rods, joints,
or in any manner. We have already seen that more modern
writers on mechanics, desirous of assuming as fundamental no
wider principles than are absolutely necessary, have not
adopted the Greek axiom in all its generality, but have only
asserted that two <em>equal</em> weights have a center of
gravity midway between them. Yet the principle that every
body, however irregular, has a center of gravity, and will
be supported if that center is supported, and not otherwise,
is so far evident, that it might be employed as a
fundamental truth, if we could not resolve it into any
simpler truths: and, historically speaking, it was assumed
as evident by the Greeks. In like manner the still wider
principle, that a collection of bodies, as, for instance, a
flexible chain hanging upon one or more supports, has a
center of gravity; and that this point will descend to the
lowest possible situation, as a single body would do, has
been adopted at various periods in the history of mechanics;
and especially at conjunctures when mathematical
philosophers have had new and difficult problems to contend
with. For in almost every instance it has only been by
repeated struggles that philosophers have reduced the
solution of such problems to a clear dependence upon the
most simple axioms.</p>
<p id="b3c6s11">11. <i>Stevinus’s Proof for Oblique Forces.</i>&#8212;We have an
example of this mode of dealing with problems, in Stevinus’s
mode of reasoning concerning the Inclined Plane; which, as
we have stated in the History of Mechanics, was the first
correct published solution of that problem. Stevinus
supposes a loop of chain, or a loop of string loaded with a
series of equal balls at equal distances, to hang over the
Inclined Plane; and his reasoning proceeds upon this
assumption,&#8212;That such a loop so hanging will find a certain
position in which it will rest: for otherwise, says
he<a id="fnanchor16-3" href="#note16-3"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>, its motion must go on for ever, which is absurd.
It may be asked how <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page228">228</a></span> this absurdity of a perpetual
motion appears; and it will perhaps be added, that although
the impossibility of a machine with such a condition may be
proved as a remote result of mechanical principles, this
impossibility can hardly be itself recognized as a
self-evident truth. But to this we may reply, that the
impossibility is really evident in the case contemplated by
Stevinus; for we cannot conceive a loop of chain to go on
through all eternity, sliding round and round upon its
support, by the effect of its own weight. And the ground of
our conviction that this cannot be, seems to be this
consideration; that when the chain moves by the effect of
its weight, we consider its motion as the result of an
effort to reach some certain position, in which it can rest;
just as a single ball in a bowl moves till it comes to rest
at the lowest point of the bowl. Such an effect of weight in
the chain, we may represent to ourselves by conceiving all
the matter of the chain to be collected in one single point,
and this single heavy point to hang from the support in some
way or other, so as fitly to represent the mode of support
of the chain. In whatever manner this heavy point (the
center of gravity of the chain) be supported and controlled
in its movements, there will still be some position of rest
which it will seek and find. And thus there will be some
corresponding position of rest for the chain; and the
interminable shifting from one position to another, with no
disposition to rest in any position, cannot exist.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-3" href="#fnanchor16-3">16</a></span> Stevin. <i>Statique</i>, livre i. prop. 19.</div>
<p>Thus the demonstration of the property of the Inclined Plane
by Stevinus, depends upon a principle which, though far from
being the simplest of those to which the case can be
reduced, is still both true and evident: and the evidence of
this principle, depending upon the assumption of a center of
gravity, is of the same nature as the evidence of the Greek
statical demonstrations, the earliest real advances in the
science.</p>
<p id="b3c6s12">12. <i>Principle of Virtual Velocities.</i>&#8212;We have
referred above to an assertion often made, that we may, from
the simple principles of Mechanics, demonstrate the
impossibility of a perpetual motion. In reality, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page229">229</a></span>
however, the simplest proof of that impossibility, in a
machine acted upon by weight only, arises from the very
maxim above stated, that the center of gravity seeks and
finds the lowest place; or from some similar proposition.
For if, as is done by many writers, we profess to prove the
impossibility of a perpetual motion by means of that
proposition which includes the conditions of equilibrium,
and is called the <i>Principle of Virtual
Velocities</i><a id="fnanchor17-3" href="#note17-3"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>, we are under the necessity of first
proving in a general manner that principle. And if this be
done by a mere enumeration of cases, (as by taking those
five cases which are called the <i>Mechanical Powers</i>,)
there may remain some doubts whether the enumeration of
possible mechanical combinations be complete. Accordingly,
some writers have attempted independent and general proofs
of the Principle of Virtual Velocities; and these proofs
rest upon assumptions of the same nature as that now under
notice. This is, for example, the case with Lagrange’s
proof, which depends upon what he calls the <i>Principle of
Pulleys</i>. For this principle is,&#8212;That a weight any how
supported, as by a string passing round any number of
pulleys any how placed, will be at rest then only, when it
cannot get lower by any small motion of the pulleys. And
thus the maxim that a weight will descend if it can, is
assumed as the basis of this proof.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-3" href="#fnanchor17-3">17</a></span> See <i>Hist. Ind Sc.</i> b. vi. c. ii. sect. 4.</div>
<p>There is, as we have said, no need to assume such principles
as these for the foundation of our mechanical science. But
it is, on various accounts, useful to direct our attention
to those cases in which truths, apprehended at first in a
complex and derivative form, have afterwards been reduced to
their simpler elements;&#8212;in which, also, sagacious and
inventive men have fixed upon those truths as self-evident,
which now appear to us only certain in virtue of
demonstration. In these cases we can hardly doubt that such
men were led to assert the doctrines which they discovered,
not by any capricious conjecture of arbitrary selection, but
by having a keener and deeper insight than other persons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page230">230</a></span> into the relations which were the object of their
contemplation; and in the science now spoken of, they were
led to their assumptions by possessing clearly and
distinctly the conceptions of mechanical cause and
effect,&#8212;action and reaction,&#8212;force, and the nature of its
operation.</p>
<p id="b3c6s13">13. <i>Fluids press Equally in all Directions.</i>&#8212;The
doctrines which concern the equilibrium of fluids depend on
principles no less certain and simple than those which refer
to the equilibrium of solid bodies; and the Greeks, who, as
we have seen, obtained a clear view of some of the
principles of Statics, also made a beginning in the kindred
subject of Hydrostatics. We still possess a treatise of
Archimedes <i>On Floating Bodies</i>, which contains correct
solutions of several problems belonging to this subject, and
of some which are by no means easy. In this treatise, the
fundamental assumption is of this kind: ‘Let it be assumed
that the nature of a fluid is such, that the parts which are
less pressed yield to those which are more pressed.’ In this
assumption or axiom it is implied that a pressure exerted
upon a fluid in one direction produces a pressure in another
direction; thus, the weight of the fluid which arises from a
downward force produces a lateral pressure against the sides
of the containing vessel. Not only does the pressure thus
diverge from its original direction into all other
directions, but the pressure is in all directions exactly
equal, an equal extent of the fluid being taken. This
principle, which was involved in the reasoning of
Archimedes, is still to the present day the basis of all
hydrostatical treatises, and is expressed, as above, by
saying that <em>fluids press equally in all directions</em>.</p>
<p>Concerning this, as concerning previously-noticed
principles, we have to ask whether it can rightly be said to
be derived from experience. And to this the answer must
still be, as in the former cases, that the proposition is
not one borrowed from experience in any usual or exact sense
of the phrase. I will endeavour to illustrate this. There
are many elementary propositions in physics, our knowledge
of which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page231">231</a></span> indisputably depends upon experience; and in
these cases there is no difficulty in seeing the evidence of
this dependence. In such cases, the <em>experiments</em> which prove
the law are prominently stated in treatises upon the
subject: they are given with exact measures, and with an
account of the means by which errours were avoided: the
experiments of more recent times have either rendered more
certain the law originally asserted, or have pointed out
some correction of it as requisite: and the names, both of
the discoverers of the law and of its subsequent reformers,
are well known. For instance, the proposition that ‘The
elastic force of air varies as the density,’ was first
proved by Boyle, by means of operations of which the detail
is given in his <i>Defence</i> of his <i>Pneumatical
Experiments</i><a id="fnanchor18-3" href="#note18-3"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>; and by <span class="correction" title="emended from Marriotte, and again at end of sentence">Mariotte</span> in his <i>Traité de
l’Équilibre des Liquides</i>, from whom it has generally
been termed Mariotte’s law. After being confirmed by many
other experimenters, this law was suspected to be slightly
inaccurate, and a commission of the French Academy of
Sciences was appointed, consisting of several distinguished
philosophers<a id="fnanchor19-3" href="#note19-3"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>, to ascertain the truth or falsehood of
this suspicion. The result of their investigations appeared
to be, that the law is exact, as nearly as the inevitable
inaccuracies of machinery and measures will allow us to
judge. Here we have an example of a law which is of the
simplest kind and form; and which yet is not allowed to rest
upon its simplicity or apparent probability, but is
rigorously tested by experience. In this case, the
assertion, that the law depends upon experience, contains a
reference to plain and notorious passages in the history of
science.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-3" href="#fnanchor18-3">18</a></span> Shaw’s <i>Boyle</i>, Vol. ii. p. 671.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-3" href="#fnanchor19-3">19</a></span> The members were Prony, Arago, Ampère, Girard,
and Dulong. The experiments were extended to a pressure of
twenty-seven atmospheres; and in no instance did the
difference between the observed and calculated elasticity
amount to one-hundredth of the whole; nor did the difference
appear to increase with the increase of pressure.&#8212;Fechner,
<i>Repertorium</i>, i. 110.</div>
<p>Now with regard to the principle that fluids press equally
in all directions, the case is altogether different. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page232">232</a></span>
It is, indeed, often asserted in works on hydrostatics, that
the principle is collected from experience, and sometimes a
few experiments are described as exhibiting its effect; but
these are such as to illustrate and explain, rather than to
prove, the truth of the principle: they are never related to
have been made with that exactness of precaution and
measurement, or that frequency of repetition, which are
necessary to establish a purely experimental truth. Nor did
such experiments occur as important steps in the history of
science. It does not appear that Archimedes thought
experiment necessary to confirm the truth of the law as he
employed it: on the contrary, he states it in exactly the
same shape as the axioms which he employs in statics, and
even in geometry; namely, as an assumption. Nor does any
intelligent student of the subject find any difficulty in
assenting to this fundamental principle of hydrostatics as
soon as it is propounded to him. Experiment was not
requisite for its discovery; experiment is not necessary for
its proof at present; and we may add, that experiment,
though it may make the proposition the more readily
intelligible, can add nothing to our conviction of its truth
when it is once understood.</p>
<p id="b3c6s14">14. <i>Foundation of the above Axiom.</i>&#8212;But it will
naturally be asked, What then is the ground of our
conviction of this doctrine of the equal pressure of a fluid
in all directions? And to this I reply, that the reasons of
this conviction are involved in our idea of a fluid, which
is considered as matter, and therefore as capable of
receiving, resisting, and transmitting force according to
the general conception of matter; and which is also
considered as matter which has its parts perfectly moveable
among one another. For it follows from these suppositions,
that if the fluid be confined, a pressure which thrusts in
one side of the containing vessel, may cause any other side
to bulge outwards, if there be a part of the surface which
has not strength to resist this pressure from within. And
that this pressure, when thus transferred into a direction
different from the original one, is not altered in
intensity, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page233">233</a></span> depends upon this consideration; that any
difference in the two pressures would be considered as a
defect of <em>perfect</em> fluidity, since the fluidity
would be still more complete, if this entire and
undiminished transmission of pressure in all directions were
supposed. If, for instance, the lateral pressure were less
than the vertical, this could be conceived no other way than
as indicating some rigidity or adhesion of the parts of the
fluid. When the fluidity is perfect, the two pressures which
act in the two different parts of the fluid exactly balance
each other: they are the action and the reaction; and must
hence be equal by the same necessity as two directly
opposite forces in statics.</p>
<p>But it may be urged, that even if we grant that this
conception of a perfect fluid, as a body which has its parts
perfectly moveable among each other, leads us necessarily to
the principle of the equality of hydrostatic pressure in all
directions, still this conception itself is obtained from
experience, or suggested by observation. And to this we may
reply, that the conception of a fluid, as contemplated in
mechanical theory, cannot be said to be derived from
experience, except in the same manner as the conception of a
solid and rigid body may be said to be acquired by
experience. For if we imagine a vessel full of small, smooth
spherical balls, such a collection of balls would approach
to the nature of a fluid, in having its parts moveable among
each other; and would approach to perfect fluidity, as the
balls became smoother and smaller. And such a collection of
balls would also possess the statical properties of a fluid;
for it would transmit pressure out of a vertical into a
lateral (or any other) direction, in the same manner as a
fluid would do. And thus a collection of solid bodies has
the same property which a fluid has; and the science of
Hydrostatics borrows from experience no principles beyond
those which are involved in the science of Statics
respecting solids. And since in this latter portion of
science, as we have already seen, none of the principles
depend for their evidence upon any special experience, the
doctrines of Hydrostatics also are not <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page234">234</a></span> proved by
experience, but have a necessary truth borrowed from the
relations of our ideas.</p>
<p>It is hardly to be expected that the above reasoning will,
at first sight, produce conviction in the mind of the
reader, except he have, to a certain extent, acquainted
himself with the elementary doctrines of the science of
Hydrostatics as usually delivered; and have followed, with
clear and steady apprehension, some of the trains of
reasoning by which the pressures of fluids are determined;
as, for instance, the explanation of what is called <i>the
Hydrostatic Paradox</i>. The necessity of such a discipline
in order that the reader may enter fully into this part of
our speculations, naturally renders them less popular; but
this disadvantage is inevitable in our plan. We cannot
expect to throw light upon philosophy by means of the
advances which have been made in the mathematical and
physical sciences, except we really understand the doctrines
which have been firmly established in those sciences. This
preparation for philosophizing may be somewhat laborious;
but such labour is necessary if we would pursue speculative
truth with all the advantages which the present condition of
human knowledge places within our reach.</p>
<p>We may add, that the consequences to which we are directed
by the preceding opinions, are of very great importance in
their bearing upon our general views respecting human
knowledge. I trust to be able to show, that some important
distinctions are illustrated, some perplexing paradoxes
solved, and some large anticipations of the future extension
of our knowledge suggested, by means of the conclusions to
which the preceding discussions have conducted us. But
before I proceed to these general topics, I must consider
the foundations of some of the remaining portions of the
science of Mechanics.</p>

<p class="noind" id="b3c7s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>N
the History of Mechanics, I have traced the steps by
which the three Laws of Motion and the other principles of
mechanics were discovered, established, and extended to the
widest generality of form and application. We have, in these
laws, examples of principles which were, historically
speaking, obtained by reference to experience. Bearing in
mind the object and the result of the preceding discussions,
we cannot but turn with much interest to examine these
portions of science; to inquire whether there be any real
difference in the grounds and nature between the knowledge
thus obtained, and those truths which we have already
contemplated; and which, as we have seen, contain their own
evidence, and do not require proof from experiment.</p>
<p id="b3c7s2">2. <i>The First Law of Motion.</i>&#8212;The first law of motion
is, that <em>When a body moves not acted upon by any force,
it will go on perpetually in a straight line, and with a
uniform velocity.</em> Now what is the real ground of our
assent to this proposition? That it is not at first sight a
self-evident truth, appears to be clear; since from the time
of Aristotle to that of Galileo the opposite assertion was
held to be true; and it was believed that all bodies in
motion had, by their own nature, a constant tendency to move
more and more slowly, so as to stop at last. This belief,
indeed, is probably even now entertained by most persons,
till their attention is fixed upon the arguments by which
the first law of motion is established. It is, however, not
difficult to lead any person of a speculative habit <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page236">236</a></span> of
thought to see that the retardation which constantly takes
place in the motion of all bodies when left to themselves,
is, in reality, the effect of extraneous forces which
destroy the velocity. A top ceases to spin because the
friction against the ground and the resistance of the air
gradually diminish its motion, and not because its motion
has any internal principle of decay or fatigue. This may be
shown, and was, in fact, shown by Hooke before the Royal
Society, at the time when the laws of motion were still
under discussion, by means of experiments in which the
weight of the top is increased, and the resistance to motion
offered by its support, is diminished; for by such
contrivances its motion is made to continue much longer than
it would otherwise do. And by experiments of this nature,
although we can never remove the whole of the external
impediments to continued motion, and although, consequently,
there will always be some retardation; and an end of the
motion of a body left to itself, however long it may be
delayed, must at last come; yet we can establish a
conviction that if all resistance could be removed, there
would be no diminution of velocity, and thus the motion
would go on for ever.</p>
<p>If we call to mind the axioms which we formerly stated, as
containing the most important conditions involved in the
idea of Cause, it will be seen that our conviction in this
case depends upon the first axiom of Causation, that nothing
can happen without a cause. Every change in the velocity of
the moving body must have a cause; and if the change can, in
any manner, be referred to the presence of other bodies,
these are said to exert <em>force</em> upon the moving body:
and the conception of force is thus evolved from the general
idea of cause. <em>Force is any cause which has motion, or
change of motion, for its effect</em>; and thus, all the
change of velocity of a body which can be referred to
extraneous bodies,&#8212;as the air which surrounds it, or the
support on which it rests,&#8212;is considered as the effect of
forces; and this consideration is looked upon as explaining
the difference between the motion which really takes places
in the experiment, and that motion <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page237">237</a></span> which, as the law
asserts, would take place if the body were not acted on by
any forces.</p>
<p>Thus the truth of the first law of motion depends upon the
axiom that no change can take place without a cause; and
follows from the definition of force, if we suppose that
there can be none but an <em>external</em> cause of change. But in
order to establish the law, it was necessary further to be
assured that there is no <em>internal</em> cause of change of
velocity belonging to all matter whatever, and operating in
such a manner that the mere progress of time is sufficient
to produce a diminution of velocity in all moving bodies. It
appears from the history of mechanical science, that this
latter step required a reference to observation and
experiment; and that the first law of motion is so far,
historically at least, dependent upon our experience.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding this historical evidence of the need
which we have of a reference to observed facts, in order to
place this first law of motion out of doubt, it has been
maintained by very eminent mathematicians and philosophers,
that the law is, in truth, evident of itself, and does not
really rest upon experimental proof. Such, for example, is
the opinion of d’Alembert<a id="fnanchor20-3" href="#note20-3"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>, who offers what is called
an <i>à priori</i> proof of this law; that is, a
demonstration derived from our ideas alone. When a body is
put in motion, either, he says, the cause which puts it in
motion at first, suffices to make it move one foot, or the
continued action of the cause during this foot is requisite
for the motion. In the first case, the same reason which
made the body proceed to the end of the first foot will hold
for its going on through a second, a third, a fourth foot,
and so on for any number. In the second case, the same
reason which made the force continue to act during the first
foot, will hold for its acting, and therefore for the body
moving during each succeeding foot. And thus the body, once
beginning to move, must go on moving for ever.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-3" href="#fnanchor20-3">20</a></span> <i>Dynamique.</i></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page238">238</a></span> It is obvious that we might reply to this argument,
that the reasons for the body proceeding during each
succeeding foot may not necessarily be all the same; for
among these reasons may be the time which has elapsed; and
thus the velocity may undergo a change as the time proceeds:
and we require observation to inform us that it does not do so.</p>
<p>Professor Playfair has presented nearly the same argument,
although in a different and more mathematical form<a id="fnanchor21-3" href="#note21-3"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>. If
the velocity change, says he, it must change according to
some expression of calculation depending upon the time, or,
in mathematical language, must be a <i>function</i> of the
time. If the velocity diminish as the time increases, this
may be expressed by stating the velocity in each case as a
certain number, from which another quantity, or <i>term</i>,
increasing as the time increases, is subtracted. But,
Playfair adds, there is no condition involved in the nature
of the case, by which the <i>coefficients</i>, or numbers
which are to be employed, along with the number representing
the time, in calculating this second term, can be determined
to be of one magnitude rather than of any other. Therefore
he infers there can be no such coefficients, and that the
velocity is in each case equal to some constant number,
independent of the time; and is therefore the same for all
times.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-3" href="#fnanchor21-3">21</a></span> <i>Outlines of Natural Philosophy</i>, p. 26.</div>
<p>In reply to this we may observe, that the circumstance of
<em>our not seeing</em> in the nature of the case anything
which determines for us the coefficients above spoken of,
cannot prove that they have not some certain value <em>in
nature</em>. We do not see in the nature of the case
anything which should determine a body to fall sixteen feet
in a second of time, rather than one foot or one hundred
feet: yet in fact the space thus run through by falling
bodies is determined to a certain magnitude. It would be
easy to assign a mathematical expression for the velocity of
a body, implying that one-hundredth of the velocity, or any
other <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page239">239</a></span> fraction, is lost in each second<a id="fnanchor22-3" href="#note22-3"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>: and
where is the absurdity of supposing such an expression
really to represent the velocity?</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-3" href="#fnanchor22-3">22</a></span>  This would be the case, if, <i>t</i> being the
number of seconds elapsed, and <i>C</i> some constant
quantity, the velocity were expressed by this mathematical
formula, <i>C</i>(<span style="font-size: 80%"><sup>99</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub></span>)<sup><i>t</i></sup>.</div>
<p>Most modern writers on mechanics have embraced the opposite
opinion, and have ascribed our knowledge of this first law
of motion to experience. Thus M. Poisson, one of the most
eminent of the mathematicians who have written on this
subject, says<a id="fnanchor23-3" href="#note23-3"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>, “We cannot affirm <i>à priori</i> that
the velocity communicated to a body will not become slower
and slower of itself, and end by being entirely
extinguished. It is only by experience and induction that
this question can be decided.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-3" href="#fnanchor23-3">23</a></span> Poisson, <i>Dynamique</i>, ed. 2, art. 113.</div>
<p>Yet it cannot be denied that there is much force in those
arguments by which it is attempted to show that the First
Law of Motion, such as we find it, is more consonant to our
conceptions than any other would be. The Law, as it exists,
is the most simple that we can conceive. Instead of having
to determine by experiments what is the law of the natural
change of velocity, we find the Law to be that it does not
change at all. To a certain extent, the Law depends upon the
evident axiom, that no change can take place without a
cause. But the question further occurs, whether the mere
lapse of time may not be a cause of change of velocity. In
order to ensure this, we have recourse to experiment; and
the result is that time alone does not produce any such
change. In addition to the conditions of change which we
collect from our own Ideas, we ask of Experience what other
conditions and circumstances she has to offer; and the
answer is, that she can point out none; When we have removed
the alterations which external causes, in our very
conception of them, occasion, there are no longer any
alterations. Instead of having to guide ourselves <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page240">240</a></span> by
experience, we learn that on this subject she has nothing to
tell us. Instead of having to take into account a number of
circumstances, we find that we have only to reject all
circumstances. The velocity of a body remains unaltered by
time alone, of whatever kind the body itself be.</p>
<p>But the doctrine that time alone is not a cause of change of
velocity in any body is further recommended to us by this
consideration;&#8212;that time is conceived by us not as a cause,
but only as a condition of other causes producing their
effects. Causes operate in time; but it is only when the
cause exists, that the lapse of time can give rise to
alterations. When therefore all external causes of change of
velocity are supposed to be removed, the velocity must
continue identical with itself, whatever the time which
elapses. An eternity of negation can produce no positive
result.</p>
<p>Thus, though the discovery of the First Law of Motion was
made, historically speaking, by means of experiment, we have
now attained a point of view in which we see that it might
have been certainly known to be true independently of
experience. This law in its ultimate form, when completely
simplified and steadily contemplated, assumes the character
of a self-evident truth. We shall find the same process to
take place in other instances. And this feature in the
progress of science will hereafter be found to suggest very
important views with regard both to the nature and prospects
of our knowledge.</p>
<p id="b3c7s3">3. <i>Gravity is a Uniform Force.</i>&#8212;We shall find
observations of the same kind offering themselves in a
manner more or less obvious, with regard to the other
principles of Dynamics. The determination of the laws
according to which bodies fall downwards by the common
action of gravity, has already been noticed in the History
of Mechanics<a id="fnanchor24-3" href="#note24-3"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>, as one of the earliest positive advances
in the doctrine of motion. These laws were first rightly
stated by Galileo, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page241">241</a></span> established by reasoning and by
experiment, not without dissent and controversy. The amount
of these doctrines is this: That gravity is a uniform
accelerating force; such a <em>uniform force</em> having
this for its character, that it <em>makes the velocity
increase in exact proportion to the time of motion</em>. The
relation which the spaces described by the body bear to the
times in which they are described, is obtained by
mathematical deduction from this definition of the force.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-3" href="#fnanchor24-3">24</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vi. c. ii. sect. 2.</div>
<p>The clear Definition of a uniform accelerating force, and
the Proposition that gravity is such a force, were
co-ordinate and contemporary steps in this discovery. In
defining accelerating force, reference, tacit or express,
was necessarily made to the second of the general axioms
respecting causation,&#8212;That causes are measured by their
effects. Force, in the cases now under our notice, is
conceived to be, as we have already stated, (<a href="#v1page236">p. 236</a>,) any
cause which, acting from without, changes the motion of a
body. It must, therefore, in this acceptation, be measured
by the magnitude of the changes which are produced. But in
what manner the changes of motion are to be employed as the
measures of force, is learnt from observation of the facts
which we see taking place in the world. Experience
<em>interprets</em> the axiom of causation, from which
otherwise we could not deduce any real knowledge. We may
assume, in virtue of our general conceptions of force, that
under the same circumstances, a greater change of motion
implies a greater force producing it; but what are we to
expect when the circumstances change? The weight of a body
makes it fall from rest at first, and causes it to move more
quickly as it descends lower. We may express this by saying,
that gravity, the universal force which makes all
terrestrial bodies fall when not supported, by its
continuous action first <em>gives</em> velocity to the body
when it has none, and afterwards <em>adds</em> velocity to
that which the body already has. But how is the velocity
added proportioned to the velocity which already exists?
Force acting on a body at rest, and on a body in motion,
appears under very different <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page242">242</a></span> conditions;&#8212;how are the
effects related? Let the force be conceived to be in both
cases the same, since force is conceived to depend upon the
extraneous bodies, and not upon the condition of the moving
mass itself. But the force being the same, the effects may
still be different. It is at first sight conceivable that
the body, acted upon by the same gravity, may receive a less
addition of velocity when it is already moving in the
direction in which this gravity impels it; for if we
ourselves push a body forwards, we can produce little
additional effect upon it when it is already moving rapidly
away from us. May it not be true, in like manner, that
although gravity be always the same force, its effect
depends upon the velocity which the body under its influence
already possesses?</p>
<p>Observation and reasoning combined, as we have said, enabled
Galileo to answer these questions. He asserted and proved
that we may consistently and properly measure a force by the
velocity which is by it generated in a body, in some certain
time, as one second; and further, that if we adopt this
measure, gravity will be a force of the same value under all
circumstances of the body which it affects; since it
appeared that, in fact, a falling body does receive equal
increments of velocity in equal times from first to last.</p>
<p>If it be asked whether we could have known, anterior to, or
independent of, experiment, that gravity is a uniform force
in the sense thus imposed upon the term; it appears clear
that we must reply, that we could not have attained to such
knowledge, since other laws of the motion of bodies
downwards are easily conceivable, and nothing but
observation could inform us that one of these laws does not
prevail in fact. Indeed, we may add, that the assertion that
the force of gravity is uniform, is so far from being
self-evident, that it is not even true; for gravity varies
according to the distance from the center of the earth; and
although this variation is so small as to be, in the case of
falling bodies, imperceptible, it negatives the rigorous
uniformity of the force as completely, though <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page243">243</a></span> not to
the same extent, as if the weight of a body diminished in a
marked degree, when it was carried from the lower to the
upper room of a house. It cannot, then, be a truth
independent of experience, that gravity is uniform.</p>
<p>Yet, in fact, the assertion that gravity is uniform was
assented to, not only before it was proved, but even before
it was clearly understood. It was readily granted by all,
that bodies which fall freely are <em>uniformly</em>
accelerated; but while some held the opinion just stated,
that uniformly accelerated motion is that in which the
velocity increases in proportion to the <em>time</em>,
others maintained, that <em>that</em> is uniformly
accelerated motion, in which the velocity increases in
proportion to the <em>space</em>; so that, for example, a
body in falling vertically through twenty feet should
acquire twice as great a velocity as one which falls through
ten feet.</p>
<p>These two opinions are both put forward by the interlocutors
of Galileo’s Dialogue on this subject<a id="fnanchor25-3" href="#note25-3"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>. And the latter
supposition is rejected, the author showing, not that it is
inconsistent with experience, but that it is impossible in
itself: inasmuch as it would inevitably lead to the
conclusion, that the fall through a large and a small
vertical space would occupy exactly the same time.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-3" href="#fnanchor25-3">25</a></span> <i>Dialogo</i>, iii. p. 95.</div>
<p>Indeed, Galileo assumes his definition of uniformly
accelerated motion as one which is sufficiently recommended
by its own simplicity. ‘If we attend carefully,’ he says,
‘we shall find that no mode of increase of velocity is more
simple than that which adds equal increments in equal times.
Which we may easily understand if we consider the close
affinity of time and motion: for as the uniformity of motion
is defined by the equality of spaces described in equal
times, so we may conceive the uniformity of acceleration to
exist when equal velocities are added in equal times.’</p>
<p>Galileo’s mode of supporting his opinion, that bodies
falling by the action of gravity are thus uniformly <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page244">244</a></span>
accelerated, consists, in the first place, in adducing the
maxim that nature always employs the most simple
means<a id="fnanchor26-3" href="#note26-3"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>. But he is far from considering this a decisive
argument. ‘I,’ says one of his speakers, ‘as it would be
very unreasonable in me to gainsay this or any other
definition which any author may please to make, since they
are all arbitrary, may still, without offence, doubt whether
such a definition, conceived and admitted in the abstract,
fits, agrees, and is verified in that kind of accelerated
motion which bodies have when they descend naturally.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-3" href="#fnanchor26-3">26</a></span> <i>Dialogo</i>, iii. p. 91.</div>
<p>The experimental proof that bodies, when they fall
downwards, are uniformly accelerated, is (by Galileo)
derived from the inclined plane; and therefore assumes the
proposition, that if such uniform acceleration prevail in
vertical motion, it will also hold when a body is compelled
to describe an oblique rectilinear path. This proposition
may be shown to be true, if (assuming by anticipation the
Third Law of Motion, of which we shall shortly have to
speak,) we introduce the conception of a uniform statical
force as the cause of uniform acceleration. For the force on
the inclined plane bears a constant proportion to the
vertical force, and this proportion is known from statical
considerations. But in the work of which we are speaking,
Galileo does not introduce this abstract conception of force
as the foundation of his doctrines. Instead of this, he
proposes, as a postulate sufficiently evident to be made the
basis of his reasonings, That bodies which descend down
inclined planes of different inclinations, but of the same
vertical height, all acquire the same velocity<a id="fnanchor27-3" href="#note27-3"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>. But
when this postulate has been propounded by one of the
persons of the dialogue, another interlocutor says, ‘You
discourse very probably; but besides this likelihood, I wish
to augment the probability so far, that it shall be almost
as complete as a necessary demonstration.’ He then proceeds
to describe a very ingenious and simple experiment, which
shows that when a body is made to swing upwards at the end
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page245">245</a></span> a string, it attains to the same height, whatever
is the path it follows, so long as it starts from the lowest
point with the same velocity. And thus Galileo’s postulate
is experimentally confirmed, so far as the force of gravity
can be taken as an example of the forces which the postulate
contemplates: and conversely, gravity is proved to be a
uniform force, so far as it can be considered clear that the
postulate is true of uniform forces.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-3" href="#fnanchor27-3">27</a></span> <i>Dialogo</i>, iii. p. 36.</div>
<p>When we have introduced the conception and definition of
accelerating force, Galileo’s postulate, that bodies
descending down inclined planes of the same vertical height,
acquire the same velocity, may, by a few steps of reasoning,
be demonstrated to be true of uniform forces: and thus the
proof that gravity, either in vertical or oblique motion, is
a uniform force, is confirmed by the experiment above
mentioned; as it also is, on like grounds, by many other
experiments, made upon inclined planes and pendulums.</p>
<p>Thus the propriety of Galileo’s conception of a uniform
force, and the doctrine that gravity is a uniform force,
were confirmed by the same reasonings and experiments. We
may make here two remarks; <i>First</i>, that the
conception, when established and rightly stated, appears so
simple as hardly to require experimental proof; a remark
which we have already made with regard to the First Law of
Motion: and <i>Second</i>, that the discovery of the real
law of nature was made by assuming propositions which,
without further proof, we should consider as very
precarious, and as far less obvious, as well as less
evident, than the law of nature in its simple form.</p>
<p id="b3c7s4">4. <i>The Second Law of Motion.</i>&#8212;When a body, instead of
falling downwards from rest, is thrown in any direction, it
describes a curve line, till its motion is stopped. In this,
and in all other cases in which a body describes a curved
path in free space, its motion is determined by the Second
Law of Motion. The law, in its general form, is as
follows:&#8212;When a body is thus cast forth and acted upon by a
force in a direction <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page246">246</a></span> transverse to its motion, the
result is, That <em>there is combined with the motion with
which the body is thrown, another motion, exactly the same
as that which the same force would have communicated to a
body at rest</em>.</p>
<p>It will readily be understood that the basis of this law is
the axiom already stated, that effects are measured by their
causes. In virtue of this axiom, the effect of gravity
acting upon a body in a direction transverse to its motion,
must measure the accelerative or deflective force of gravity
under those circumstances. If this effect vary with the
varying velocity and direction of the body thus acted upon,
the deflective force of gravity also will vary with those
circumstances. The more simple supposition is, that the
deflective force of gravity is the same, whatever be the
velocity and direction of the body which is subjected to its
influence: and this is the supposition which we find to be
verified by facts. For example, a ball let fall from the top
of a ship’s upright mast, when she is sailing steadily
forward, will fall at the foot of the mast, just as if it
were let fall while the ship were at rest; thus showing that
the motion which gravity gives to the ball is compounded
with the horizontal motion which the ball shares with the
ship from the first. This general and simple conception of
motions as <em>compounded</em> with one another, represents,
it is proved, the manner in which the motion produced by
gravity modifies any other motion which the body may
previously have had.</p>
<p>The discussions which terminated in the general reception of
this Second Law of Motion among mechanical writers, were
much mixed up with the arguments for and against the
Copernican system, which system represented the earth as
revolving upon its axis. For the obvious argument against
this system was, that if each point of the earth’s surface
were thus in motion from west to east, a stone dropt from
the top of a tower would be left behind, the tower moving
away from it: and the answer was, that by this law of
motion, the stone would have the earth’s motion impressed
upon it, as well as that motion which would <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page247">247</a></span> arise from
its gravity to the earth; and that the motion of the stone
relative to the tower would thus be the same as if both
earth and tower were at rest. Galileo further urged, as a
presumption in favour of the opinion that the two
motions,&#8212;the circular motion arising from the rotation of
the earth, and the downward motion arising from the gravity
of the stone, would be compounded in the way we have
described, (neither of them disturbing or diminishing the
other,)&#8212;that the first motion was in its own nature not
liable to any change or diminution<a id="fnanchor28-3" href="#note28-3"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a>, as we learn from
the First Law of Motion. Nor was the subject lightly
dismissed. The experiment of the stone let fall from the top
of the mast was made in various forms by Gassendi; and in
his Epistle, <i>De Motu impresso a Motore translato</i>, the
rule now in question is supported by reference to these
experiments. In this manner, the general truth, the Second
Law of Motion, was established completely and beyond
dispute.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-3" href="#fnanchor28-3">28</a></span> <i>Dialogo</i>, ii. p. 114.</div>
<p>But when this law had been proved to be true in a general
sense, with such accuracy as rude experiments, like those of
Galileo and Gassendi, would admit, it still remained to be
ascertained (supposing our knowledge of the law to be the
result of experience alone,) whether it were true with that
precise and rigorous exactness which more refined modes of
experimenting could test. We so willingly believe in the
simplicity of laws of nature, that the rigorous accuracy of
such a law, known to be at least approximately true, was
taken for granted, till some ground for suspecting the
contrary should appear. Yet calculations have not been
wanting which might confirm the law as true to the last
degree of accuracy. Laplace relates (<i>Syst. du Monde</i>,
livre iv. chap. 16,) that at one time he had conceived it
possible that the effect of gravity upon the moon might be
slightly modified by the moon’s direction and velocity; and
that in this way an explanation might be found for the
moon’s <em>acceleration</em> (a deviation of her observed
from her calculated place, which long <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page248">248</a></span> perplexed
mathematicians). But it was after some time discovered that
this feature in the moon’s motion arose from another cause;
and the second law of motion was confirmed as true in the
most rigorous sense.</p>
<p>Thus we see that although there were arguments which might
be urged in favour of this law, founded upon the necessary
relations of ideas, men became convinced of its truth only
when it was verified and confirmed by actual experiment. But
yet in this case again, as in the former ones, when the law
had been established beyond doubt or question, men were very
ready to believe that it was not a mere result of
observation,&#8212;that the truth which it contained was not
derived from experience,&#8212;that it might have been assumed as
true in virtue of reasonings anterior to experience,&#8212;and
that experiments served only to make the law more plain and
intelligible, as visible diagrams in geometry serve to
illustrate geometrical truths; our knowledge not being (they
deemed) in mechanics, any more than in geometry, borrowed
from the senses. It was thought by many to be self-evident,
that the effect of a force in any direction cannot be
increased or diminished by any motion transverse to the
direction of the force which the body may have at the same
time: or, to express it otherwise, that if the motion of the
body be compounded of a horizontal and vertical motion, the
vertical motion alone will be affected by the vertical
force. This principle, indeed, not only has appeared evident
to many persons, but even at the present day is assumed as
an axiom by many of the most eminent mathematicians. It is,
for example, so employed in the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i> of
Laplace, which may be looked upon as the standard of
mathematical mechanics in our time; and in the <i>Mécanique
Analytique</i> of Lagrange, the most consummate example
which has appeared of subtilty of thought on such subjects,
as well as of power of mathematical generalization<a id="fnanchor29-3" href="#note29-3"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a>.
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page249">249</a></span> thus we have here another example of that
circumstance which we have already noticed in speaking of
the First Law of Motion, (<a href="#b3c7s2">Art. 2</a> of this chapter,) and of
the Law that Gravity is a uniform Force, (<a href="#b3c7s3">Art. 3</a>); namely,
that the law, though historically established by
experiments, appears, when once discovered and reduced to
its most simple and general form, to be self-evident. I am
the more desirous of drawing attention to this feature in
various portions of the history of science, inasmuch as it
will be found to lead to some very extensive and important
views, hereafter to be considered.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-3" href="#fnanchor29-3">29</a></span> I may observe that the rule that we may
<em>compound</em> motions, as the Law supposes, is involved
in the step of <em>resolving</em> them; which is done in the
passage to which I refer. (<i>Méc. Analyt.</i> ptie. i.
sect. i. art. 3. p. 225.) ‘Si on conçoit que le mouvement
d’un corps et les forces qui le sollicitent soient
<em>decomposées</em> suivant trois lignes droites
perpendiculaires entre elles, on pourra considérer
séparément les mouvemens et les forces relatives à chacun de
ces trois directions. Car à cause de la perpendicularité des
directions il est visible que chacun de ces mouvemens
partiels peut être regardé comme indépendant des deux
autres, et qu’il ne peut recevoir d’altération que de la
part de la force qui agit dans la direction de ce mouvement;
l’on peut conclure que ces trois mouvemens doivent suivre,
chacun en particulier, les lois des mouvemens rectilignes
accélérés ou retardés par les forces données.’ Laplace makes
the same assumption in effect, (<i>Méc. Cél.</i> p. i. liv.
i. art. 7), by resolving the forces which act upon a point
in three rectangular directions, and reasoning separately
concerning each direction. But in his mode of treating the
subject is involved a principle which belongs to the Third
Law of Motion, namely, the doctrine that the velocity is as
the force, of which we shall have to speak elsewhere.</div>
<p id="b3c7s5">5. <i>The Third Law of Motion.</i>&#8212;We have, in the
definition of Accelerating Force, a measure of Forces, so
far as they are concerned in producing motion. We had
<a href="#b3c6s3">before</a>, in speaking of the principles of statics, defined
the measure of Forces or Pressures, so far as they are
employed in producing equilibrium. But these two aspects of
Force are closely connected; and we require a law which
shall lay down the rule of their connexion. By the same kind
of muscular exertion by which we can support a heavy stone,
we can also put it in motion. The question then occurs, how
is the rate and manner of its motion determined? The answer
to this question is contained in the Third Law <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page250">250</a></span> of
Motion, and it is to this effect: that the <em>Momentum</em>
which any pressure produces in the mass in a given time is
proportional to the pressure. By <i>Momentum</i> is meant
the product of the numbers which express the velocity and
the mass of the body: and hence, if the mass of the body be
the same in the instances which we compare, the rule is,&#8212;That
<em>the velocity is as the force which produces it</em>; and this
is one of the simplest ways of expressing the Third Law of Motion.</p>
<p>In agreement with our general plan, we have to ask, What is
the ground of this rule? What is the simplest and most
satisfactory form to which we can reduce the proof of it?
Or, to take an instance; if a double pressure be exerted
against a given mass, so disposed as to be capable of
motion, why must it produce twice the velocity in the same
time?</p>
<p>To answer this question, suppose the double pressure to be
resolved into two single pressures: one of these will
produce a certain velocity; and the question is, why an
equal pressure, acting upon the same mass, will produce an
equal velocity <em>in addition</em> to the former? Or,
stating the matter otherwise, the question is, why each of
the two forces will produce its separate effect, unaltered
by the simultaneous action of the other force?</p>
<p>This statement of the case makes it seem to approach very
near to such cases as are included in the Second Law of
Motion, and therefore it might appear that this Third Law
has no grounds distinct from the Second. But it must be
recollected that the word <i>force</i> has a different
meaning in this case and in that; in this place it signifies
<i>pressure</i>; in the statement of the Second Law its
import was <i>accelerative</i> or <i>deflective force</i>,
measured by the velocity or deflexion generated. And thus
the Third Law of Motion, so far as our reasonings yet go,
appears to rest on a foundation different from the Second.</p>
<p>Accordingly, that part of the Third Law of Motion which we
are now considering, that the velocity generated is as the
force, was obtained, in fact, by a separate train of
research. The first exemplification of this <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page251">251</a></span> law which
was studied by mathematicians, was the motion of bodies upon
inclined planes: for the force which urges a body down an
inclined plane is known by statics, and hence the velocity
of its descent was to be determined. Galileo
originally<a id="fnanchor30-3" href="#note30-3"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> in his attempts to solve this problem of
the descent of a body down an inclined plane, did not
proceed from the principle which we have stated, (the
determination of the force which acts down the inclined
plane from statical considerations,) obvious as it may seem;
but assumed, as we have already seen, a proposition
apparently far more precarious;&#8212;namely, that a body sliding
down a smooth inclined plane acquires always the same
velocity, so long as the <em>vertical</em> height fallen
through is the same. And this conjecture (for at first it
was nothing more than a conjecture) he confirmed by an
ingenious experiment; in which bodies acquired or lost the
same velocity by descending or ascending through the same
height, although their paths were different in other
respects.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-3" href="#fnanchor30-3">30</a></span> <i>Dial. della Sc. Nuov.</i> iii. p. 96. See
<i>Hist. Ind. Sci.</i> b. vi. c. ii. sect. 5.</div>
<p>This was the form in which the doctrine of the motion of
bodies down inclined planes was at first presented in
Galileo’s <i>Dialogues</i> on the Science of Motion. But his
disciple Viviani was dissatisfied with the assumption thus
introduced; and in succeeding editions of the
<i>Dialogues</i>, the apparent chasm in the reasoning was
much narrowed, by making the proof depend upon a principle
nearly identical with the third law of motion as we have
just stated it. In the proof thus added, ‘We are agreed,’
says the interlocutor<a id="fnanchor31-3" href="#note31-3"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a>, ‘that in a moving body the
impetus, energy, momentum, or propension to motion, is as
great as is the force or least resistance which suffices to
sustain it;’ and the impetus or momentum, in the course of
the proof, being taken to be as the velocity produced in a
given time, it is manifest that the principle so stated
amounts to this; that the velocity produced is as the
statical force. And thus this law of motion appears, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page252">252</a></span>
in the school of Galileo, to have been suggested and
established at first by experiment, but afterwards confirmed
and demonstrated by <i>à priori</i> considerations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note31-3" href="#fnanchor31-3">31</a></span> <i>Dialogo</i>, p. 104.</div>
<p>We see, in the above reasoning, a number of abstract terms
introduced which are not, at first at least, very distinctly
defined, as <i>impetus</i>, <i>momentum</i>, &amp;c. Of these,
<i>momentum</i> has been selected, to express that quantity
which, in a moving body, measures the statical force
impressed upon the body. This quantity is, as we have just
seen, proportional to the velocity in a given body. It is
also, in different bodies, proportional to the mass of the
body. This part of the third law of motion follows from our
conception of matter in general as consisting of parts
capable of addition. A double pressure must be required to
produce the same velocity in a double mass; for if the mass
be halved, each half will require an equal pressure; and the
addition, both of the pressures and of the masses, will take
place without disturbing the effects.</p>
<p>The measure of the quantity of matter of a body considered
as affecting the velocity which pressure produces in the
body, is termed its <i>inertia</i>, as we have already
stated (<a href="#b3c5s4">c. v.</a>). Inertia is the property by which a large mass
of matter requires a greater force than a small mass, to
give it an equal velocity. It belongs to each portion of
matter; and portions of inertia are added whenever portions
of matter are added. Hence <em>inertia is as the quantity of
matter</em>; which is only another way of expressing this
third law of motion, so far as quantity of matter is
concerned.</p>
<p>But how do we know the quantity of matter of a body? We may
reply, that we take the weight as the measure of the
quantity of matter: but we may then be again asked, how it
appears that the weight is proportional to the inertia;
which it must be, in order that the quantity of matter may
be proportional to both one and the other. We answer, that
this appears to be true experimentally, because all bodies
fall with equal velocities by gravity, when the known causes
of difference are removed. The observations of falling <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page253">253</a></span>
bodies, indeed, are not susceptible of much exactness: but
experiments leading to the same result, and capable of great
precision, were made upon pendulums by Newton; as he relates
in his <i>Principia</i>, Book <span class="sc">iii</span>. prop. 6. They all agreed,
he says, with perfect accuracy: and thus the weight and the
inertia are proportional in all cases, and therefore each
proportional to the quantity of matter as measured by the
other.</p>
<p>The conception of inertia, as we have already seen in
<a href="#b3c5s1">chapter <span class="sc">v</span>.</a>, involves the notion of action and reaction; and
thus the laws which involve inertia depend upon the idea of
mutual causation. The rule, that the velocity is as the
force, depends upon the principle of causation, that the
effect is proportional to the cause; the effect being here
so estimated as to be consistent both with the other laws of
motion and with experiment.</p>
<p>But here, as in other cases, the question occurs again; Is
experiment really requisite for the proof of this law? If we
look to authorities, we shall be not a little embarrassed to
decide. D’Alembert is against the necessity of experimental
proof. ‘Why,’ says he<a id="fnanchor32-3" href="#note32-3"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a>, ‘should we have recourse to
this principle employed, at the present day, by everybody,
that the force is proportional to the velocity? &#8230; a
principle resting solely upon this vague and obscure axiom,
that the effect is proportional to the cause. We shall not
examine here,’ he adds, ‘if this principle is necessarily
true; we shall only avow that the proofs which have hitherto
been adduced do not appear to us unexceptionable: nor shall
we, with some geometers, adopt it as a purely contingent
truth; which would be to ruin the certainty of mechanics,
and to reduce it to be nothing more than an experimental
science. We shall content ourselves with observing,’ he
proceeds, ‘that certain or doubtful, clear or obscure, it is
useless in mechanics, and consequently ought to be banished
from the science.’ Though D’Alembert rejects the third law
of motion in this form, he accepts one of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page254">254</a></span> equivalent
import, which appears to him to possess axiomatic certainty;
and this procedure is in consistence with the course which
he takes, of claiming for the science of mechanics more than
mere experimental truth. On the contrary, Laplace considers
this third law as established by experiment. ‘Is the force,’
he says’<a id="fnanchor33-3" href="#note33-3"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a>, ‘proportioned to the velocity? This,’ he
replies, ‘we cannot know <i>à priori</i>, seeing that we are
in ignorance of the nature of moving force: we must
therefore, for this purpose, recur to experience; for all
which is not a necessary consequence of the few data we have
respecting the nature of things, is, for us, only a result
of observation.’ And again he says<a id="fnanchor34-3" href="#note34-3"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a>, ‘Here, then, we
have two laws of motion,&#8212;the law of inertia [the first law
of motion], and the law of the force proportional to the
velocity,&#8212;which are given by observation. They are the most
natural and the most simple laws which we can imagine, and
without doubt they flow from the very nature of matter; but
this nature being unknown, they are, for us, only observed
facts: the only ones, however, which Mechanics borrows from
experience.’</p>

<p>It will appear, I think, from the views given in this and
several other parts of the present work, that we cannot with
justice say that we have very ‘few data respecting the
nature of things,’ in speculating concerning the laws of the
universe; since all the consequences which flow from the
relations of our fundamental ideas, necessarily regulate our
knowledge of things, so far as we have any such knowledge.
Nor can we say that the nature of matter is unknown to us,
in any sense in which we can conceive knowledge as possible.
The nature of matter is no more unknown than the nature of
space or of number. In our conception of matter, as of space
and of number, are involved certain relations, which are the
necessary groundwork of our knowledge; and anything which is
independent of these relations, is not unknown, but
inconceivable. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page255">255</a></span></p>
<p>It must be already clear to the reader, from the phraseology
employed by these two eminent mathematicians, that the
question respecting the formation of the third law of motion
can only be solved by a careful consideration of what we
mean by observation and experience, nature and matter. But
it will probably be generally allowed, that, taking into
account the explanations already offered of the necessary
conditions of experience and of the conception of inertia,
this law of motion, that the inertia is as the quantity of
matter, is almost or altogether self-evident.</p>
<p id="b3c7s6">6. <i>Action and Reaction are Equal in Moving
Bodies.</i>&#8212;When we have to consider bodies as acting upon
one another, and influencing each other’s motions, the third
law of motion is still applied; but along with this, we also
employ the general principle that action and reaction are
equal and opposite. Action and reaction are here to be
understood as momentum produced and destroyed, according to
the measure of action established by the Third Law of
Motion: and the cases in which this principle is thus
employed form so large a portion of those in which the third
law of motion is used, that some writers (Newton at the
head of them) have stated the equality of action and
reaction as the third law of motion.</p>
<p>The third law of motion being once established, the equality
of action and reaction, in the sense of momentum gained and
lost, necessarily follows. Thus, if a weight hanging by a
string over the edge of a smooth level table draw another
weight along the table, the hanging weight moves more slowly
than it would do if not so connected, and thus loses
velocity by the connexion; while the other weight gains by
the connexion all the velocity which it has, for if left to
itself it would rest. And the pressures which restrain the
descent of the first body and accelerate the motion of the
second, are equal at all instants of time, for each of these
pressures is the tension of the string: and hence, by the
third law of motion, the momentum gained by the one body,
and the momentum lost by the other in virtue of the action
of this string, are equal. And similar <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page256">256</a></span> reasoning may
be employed in any other case where bodies are connected.</p>
<p>The case where one body does not push or draw, but
<em>strikes</em> another, appeared at first to mechanical
reasoners to be of a different nature from the others; but a
little consideration was sufficient to show that a blow is,
in fact, only a short and violent pressure; and that,
therefore, the general rule of the equality of momentum lost
and gained applies to this as well as to the other cases.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to determine the case of the direct action of
bodies upon one another, we require no new law of motion.
The equality of action and reaction, which enters
necessarily into every conception of mechanical operation,
combined with the measure of action as given by the third
law of motion, enables us to trace the consequences of every
case, whether of pressure or of impact.</p>
<p id="b3c7s7">7. <i>D’Alembert’s Principle.</i>&#8212;But what will be the
result when bodies do not act directly upon each other, but
are <em>indirectly</em> connected in any way by levers,
strings, pulleys, or in any other manner, so that one part
of the system has a mechanical advantage over another? The
result must still be determined by the principle that action
and reaction balance each other. The action and reaction,
being pressures in one sense, must balance each other by the
laws of statics, for these laws determine the equilibrium of
pressure. Now action and reaction, according to their
measures in the Third Law of Motion, are momentum gained and
lost, when the action is direct; and except the indirect
action introduce some modification of the law, they must
have the same measure still. But, in fact, we cannot well
conceive any modification of the law to take place in this
case; for direct action is only one (the ultimate) case of
indirect action. Thus if two heavy bodies act at different
points of a lever, the action of each on the other is
indirect; but if the two points come together, the action
becomes direct. Hence the rule must be that which we have
already stated; for if the rule were false for indirect
action, it would <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page257">257</a></span> also be false for direct action, for
which case we have shown it to be true. And thus we obtain
the general principle, that in any system of bodies which
act on each other, action and reaction, estimated by
momentum gained and lost, balance each other according to
the laws of equilibrium. This principle, which is so general
as to supply a key to the solution of all possible
mechanical problems, is commonly called <i>D’Alembert’s
Principle</i>. The experimental proofs which convinced men
of the truth of the Third Law of Motion were, many or most
of them, proofs of the law in this extended sense. And thus
the proof of D’Alembert’s Principle, both from the idea of
mechanical action and from experience, is included in the
proof of the law already stated.</p>
<p id="b3c7s8">8. <i>Connexion of Dynamical and Statical
Principles.</i>&#8212;The principle of equilibrium of D’Alembert
just stated, is the law which he would substitute for the
Third Law of Motion; and he would thus remove the necessity
for an independent proof of that law. In like manner, the
Second Law of Motion is by some writers derived from the
principle of the composition of statical forces; and they
would thus supersede the necessity of a reference to
experiment in that case. Laplace takes this course, and
thus, as we have seen, rests only the First and Third Law of
Motion upon experience. Newton, on the other hand,
recognizes the same connexion of propositions, but for a
different purpose; for he derives the composition of
statical forces from the Second Law of Motion.</p>
<p>The close connexion of these three principles, the
composition of (statical) forces, the composition of
(accelerating) forces with velocities, and the measure of
(moving) forces by velocities, cannot be denied; yet it
appears to be by no means easy to supersede the necessity of
independent proofs of the last two of these principles. Both
may be proved or illustrated by experiment: and the
experiments which prove the one are different from those
which establish the other. For example, it appears by easy
calculations, that when we apply our principles to the
oscillations of a pendulum, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page258">258</a></span> the Second Law is proved
by the fact, that the oscillations take place at the same
rate in an east and west, and in a north and south
direction: under the same circumstances, the Third Law is
proved by our finding that the time of a small oscillation
is proportional to the square root of the length of a
pendulum; and similar differences might be pointed out in
other experiments, as to their bearing upon the one law or
the other.</p>
<p id="b3c7s9">9. <i>Mechanical Principles become gradually more simple and
more evident.</i>&#8212;I will again point out in general two
circumstances which I have already noticed in particular
cases of the laws of motion.&#8212;Truths are often at first
assumed in a form which is far from being the most obvious
or simple;&#8212;and truths once discovered are gradually
simplified, so as to assume the appearance of self-evident
truths.</p>
<p>The former circumstance is exemplified in several of the
instances which we have had to consider. The assumption,
that a perpetual motion is impossible, preceded the
knowledge of the first law of motion. The assumed equality
of the velocities acquired down two inclined planes of the
same height, was afterwards reduced to the third law of
motion by Galileo himself. In the History<a id="fnanchor35-3" href="#note35-3"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a>, we have
noted Huyghens’s assumption of the equality of the actual
descent and potential ascent of the center of gravity: this
was afterwards reduced by Herman and the Bernoullis, to the
statical equivalence of the solicitations of gravity and the
vicarious solicitations of the effective forces which act on
each point; and finally to the principle of D’Alembert,
which asserts that the motions gained and lost balance each
other.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-3" href="#fnanchor35-3">35</a></span> B. vi. c. v. sect. 2.</div>
<p>This early assertion of principles which now appear neither
obvious nor self-evident, is not to be considered as a
groundless assumption on the part of the discoverers by whom
it was made. On the contrary, it is evidence of the deep
sagacity and clear thought which were <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page259">259</a></span> requisite in
order to make such discoveries. For these results are really
rigorous consequences of the laws of motion in their
simplest form: and the evidence of them was probably
present, though undeveloped, in the minds of the
discoverers. We are told of geometrical students, who, by a
peculiar aptitude of mind, perceived the evidence of some of
the more advanced propositions of geometry without going
through the introductory steps. We must suppose a similar
aptitude for mechanical reasonings, which, existing in the
minds of Stevinus, Galileo, Newton, and Huyghens, led them
to make those assumptions which finally resolved themselves
into the laws of motion.</p>
<p>We may observe further, that the simplicity and evidence
which the laws of mechanics have at length assumed, are much
favoured by the usage of words among the best writers on
such subjects. Terms which originally, and before the laws
of motion were fully known, were used in a very vague and
fluctuating sense, were afterwards limited and rendered
precise, so that assertions which at first appear identical
propositions become distinct and important principles. Thus
<i>force</i>, <i>motion</i>, <i>momentum</i>, are terms
which were employed, though in a loose manner, from the very
outset of mechanical speculation. And so long as these words
retained the vagueness of common language, it would have
been a useless and barren truism to say that ‘the momentum
is proportional to the force,’ or that ‘a body loses as much
motion as it communicates to another.’ But when ‘momentum’
and ‘quantity of motion’ are defined to mean the product of
mass and velocity, these two propositions immediately become
distinct statements of the third law of motion and its
consequences. In like manner, the assertion that ‘gravity is
a uniform force’ was assented to, before it was settled what
a uniform force was; but this assertion only became
significant and useful when that point had been properly
determined. The statement that ‘when different motions are
communicated to the same body their effects are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page260">260</a></span>
compounded,’ becomes the second law of motion, when we
define what composition of motions is. And the same process
may be observed in other cases.</p>
<p>And thus we see how well the form which science ultimately
assumes is adapted to simplify knowledge. The definitions
which are adopted, and the terms which become current in
precise senses, produce a complete harmony between the
matter and the form of our knowledge; so that truths which
were at first unexpected and recondite, became familiar
phrases, and after a few generations sound, even to common
ears, like identical propositions.</p>
<p id="b3c7s10">10. <i>Controversy of the Measure of Force.</i>&#8212;In the
History of Mechanics<a id="fnanchor36-3" href="#note36-3"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a>, we have given an account of the
controversy which, for some time, occupied the
mathematicians of Europe, whether the forces of bodies in
motion should be reckoned proportional to the velocity, or
to the square of the velocity. We need not here recall the
events of this dispute; but we may remark, that its history,
as a metaphysical controversy, is remarkable in this
respect, that it has been finally and completely settled;
for it is now agreed among mathematicians that both sides
were right, and that the results of mechanical action may be
expressed with equal correctness by means of <i>momentum</i>
and of <i>vis viva</i>. It is, in one sense, as D’Alembert
has said<a id="fnanchor37-3" href="#note37-3"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a>, a dispute about words; but we are not to
infer that, on that account, it was frivolous or useless;
for such disputes are one principal means of reducing the
principles of our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page261">261</a></span> knowledge to their utmost simplicity
and clearness. The terms which are employed in the science
of mechanics are now liberated for ever, in the minds of
mathematicians, from that ambiguity which was the
battleground in the war of the <i>vis viva</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-3" href="#fnanchor36-3">36</a></span> B. vi. c. v. sect. 2.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-3" href="#fnanchor37-3">37</a></span> D’Alembert has also remarked (<i>Dynamique</i>,
Pref. xxi.) that this controversy ‘shows how little justice
and precision there is in the pretended axiom that causes
are proportional to their effects.’ But this reflection is
by no means well founded. For since both measures are true,
it appears that causes may be <em>justly</em> measured by
their effects, even when very different kinds of effects are
taken. That the axiom does not point out one
<em>precise</em> measure, till illustrated by experience or
by other considerations, we grant: but the same thing occurs
in the application of other axioms also.</div>
<p>But we may observe that the real reason of this controversy
was exactly that tendency which we have been noticing;&#8212;the
disposition of man to assume in his speculations certain
general propositions as true, and to fix the sense of terms
so that they shall fall in with this truth. It was agreed,
on all hands, that in the mutual action of bodies the same
quantity of force is always preserved; and the question was,
by which of the two measures this rule could best be
verified. We see, therefore, that the dispute was not
concerning a definition merely, but concerning a definition
combined with a general proposition. Such a question may be
readily conceived to have been by no means unimportant; and
we may remark, in passing, that such controversies, although
they are commonly afterwards stigmatized as quarrels about
words and definitions, are, in reality, events of
considerable consequence in the history of science; since
they dissipate all ambiguity and vagueness in the use of
terms, and bring into view the conditions under which the
fundamental principles of our knowledge can be most clearly
and simply presented.</p>
<p>It is worth our while to pause for a moment on the prospect
that we have thus obtained, of the advance of knowledge, as
exemplified in the history of Mechanics. The general
transformation of our views from vague to definite, from
complex to simple, from unexpected discoveries to
self-evident truths, from seeming contradictions to
identical propositions, is very remarkable, but it is by no
means peculiar to our subject. The same circumstances, more
or less prominent, more or less developed, appear in the
history of other sciences, according to the point of advance
which each has reached. They bear upon very important
doctrines respecting the prospects, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page262">262</a></span> limits, and
the very nature of our knowledge. And though these doctrines
require to be considered with reference to the whole body of
science, yet the peculiar manner in which they are
illustrated by the survey of the history of Mechanics, on
which we have just been engaged, appears to make this a
convenient place for introducing them to the reader.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Paradox of Universal Propositions obtained from

<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b3c8s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>T
was formerly stated<a id="fnanchor38-3" href="#note38-3"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a> that experience cannot
establish any universal or necessary truths. The number of
trials which we can make of any proposition is necessarily
limited, and observation alone cannot give us any ground of
extending the inference to untried cases. Observed facts
have no visible bond of necessary connexion, and no exercise
of our senses can enable us to discover such connexion. We
can never acquire from a mere observation of facts, the
right to assert that a proposition is true in all cases, and
that it could not be otherwise than we find it to be.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-3" href="#fnanchor38-3">38</a></span> B. i. <a href="#v1page65">c. iv</a>. Of Experience</div>
<p>Yet, as we have just seen in the history of the laws of
motion, we may go on collecting our knowledge from
observation, and enlarging and simplifying it, till it
approaches or attains to complete universality and seeming
necessity. Whether the laws of motion, as we now know them,
can be rigorously traced to an absolute necessity in the
nature of things, we have not ventured absolutely to
pronounce. But we have seen that some of the most acute and
profound mathematicians have believed that, for these laws
of motion, or some of them, there was such a demonstrable
necessity compelling them to be such as they are, and no
other. Most of those who have carefully studied the
principles of Mechanics will allow that some at least of the
primary laws of motion approach very near to this character
of necessary truth; and will confess that it would be
difficult to imagine any other consistent <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page264">264</a></span> scheme of
fundamental principles. And almost all mathematicians will
allow to these laws an absolute universality; so that we may
apply them without scruple or misgiving, in cases the most
remote from those to which our experience has extended. What
astronomer would fear to refer to the known laws of motion,
in reasoning concerning the double stars; although these
objects are at an immeasurably remote distance from that
solar system which has been the only field of our
observation of mechanical facts? What philosopher, in
speculating respecting a magnetic fluid, or a luminiferous
ether, would hesitate to apply to it the mechanical
principles which are applicable to fluids of known
mechanical properties? When we assert that the quantity of
motion in the world cannot be increased or diminished by the
mutual actions of bodies, does not every mathematician feel
convinced that it would be an unphilosophical restriction to
limit this proposition to such modes of action as we have
tried?</p>
<p>Yet no one can doubt that, in historical fact, these laws
were collected from experience. That such is the case, is no
matter of conjecture. We know the time, the persons, the
circumstances, belonging to each step of each discovery. I
have, in the History, given an account of these discoveries;
and in the previous chapters of the present work, I have
further examined the nature and the import of the principles
which were thus brought to light.</p>
<p>Here, then, is an apparent contradiction. Experience, it
would seem, has done that which we had proved that she
cannot do. She has led men to propositions, universal at
least, and to principles which appear to some persons
necessary. What is the explanation of this contradiction,
the solution of this paradox? Is it true that Experience can
reveal to us universal and necessary truths? Does she
possess some secret virtue, some unsuspected power, by which
she can detect connexions and consequences which we have
declared to be out of her sphere? Can she see more than mere
appearances, and observe more than mere facts? Can <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page265">265</a></span> she
penetrate, in some way, to the nature of things?&#8212;descend
below the surface of phenomena to their causes and origins,
so as to be able to say what can and what can not be;&#8212;what
occurrences are partial, and what universal? If this be so,
we have indeed mistaken her character and powers; and the
whole course of our reasoning becomes precarious and
obscure. But, then, when we return upon our path we cannot
find the point at which we deviated, we cannot detect the
false step in our deduction. It still seems that by
experience, strictly so called, we cannot discover necessary
and universal truths. Our senses can give us no evidence of
a necessary connexion in phenomena. Our observation must be
limited, and cannot testify concerning anything which is
beyond its limits. A general view of our faculties appears
to prove it to be impossible that men should do what the
history of the science of mechanics shows that they have
done.</p>
<p id="b3c8s2">2. But in order to try to solve this Paradox, let us again
refer to the History of Mechanics. In the cases belonging to
that science, in which propositions of the most
unquestionable universality, and most approaching to the
character of necessary truths, (as, for instance, the laws
of motion,) have been arrived at, what is the source of the
axiomatic character which the propositions thus assume? The
answer to this question will, we may hope, throw some light
on the perplexity in which we appear to be involved.</p>
<p>Now the answer to this inquiry is, that the laws of motion
borrow their axiomatic character from their being merely
<em>interpretations</em> of the Axioms of Causation. Those
axioms, being exhibitions of the Idea of Cause under various
aspects, are of the most rigorous universality and
necessity. And so far as the laws of motion are
exemplifications of those axioms, these laws must be no less
universal and necessary. How these axioms are to be
understood;&#8212;in what sense <i>cause</i> and <i>effect</i>,
<i>action</i> and <i>reaction</i>, are to be taken,
experience and observation did, in fact, teach inquirers on
this subject; and without this teaching, the laws of motion
could never have been distinctly known. If two forces <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page266">266</a></span>
act together, each must produce its effect, by the axiom of
causation; and, therefore, the effects of the separate
forces must be <em>compounded</em>. But a long course of
discussion and experiment must instruct men of what kind
this <em>composition</em> of forces is. Again; action and
reaction must be equal; but much thought and some trial were
needed to show what <i>action</i> and <i>reaction</i> are.
Those metaphysicians who enunciated Laws of motion without
reference to experience, propounded only such laws as were
vague and inapplicable. But yet these persons manifested the
indestructible conviction, belonging to man’s speculative
nature, that there exist Laws of motion, that is, universal
formulæ, connecting the causes and effects when motion takes
place. Those mechanicians, again, who, observed facts
involving equilibrium and motion, and stated some narrow
rules, without attempting to ascend to any universal and
simple principle, obtained laws no less barren and useless
than the metaphysicians; for they could not tell in what new
cases, or whether in any, their laws would be
verified;&#8212;they needed a more general rule, to show them the
limits of the rule they had discovered. They went wrong in
each attempt to solve a new problem, because their
interpretation of the terms of the axioms, though true,
perhaps, in certain cases, was not right in general.</p>
<p>Thus Pappus erred in attempting to interpret as a case of
the lever, the problem of supporting a weight upon an
inclined plane; thus Aristotle erred in interpreting the
doctrine that the weight of bodies is the cause of their
fall; thus Kepler erred in interpreting the rule that the
velocity of bodies depends upon the force; thus
Bernoulli<a id="fnanchor39-3" href="#note39-3"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a> erred in interpreting the equality of action
and reaction upon a lever in motion. In each of these
instances, true doctrines, already established, (whether by
experiment or otherwise,) were erroneously applied. And the
error was corrected by further reflection, which pointed out
that another mode of interpretation was requisite, in order
that the axiom <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page267">267</a></span> which, was appealed to in each case
might retain its force in the most general sense. And in the
reasonings which avoided or corrected such errors, and which
led to substantial general truths, the object of the
speculator always was to give to the acknowledged maxims
which the Idea of Cause suggested, such a signification as
should be consistent with their universal validity. The rule
was not accepted as particular at the outset, and afterwards
generalized more and more widely; but from the very first,
the universality of the rule was assumed, and the question
was, how it should be understood so as to be universally
true. At every stage of speculation, the law was regarded as
a general law. This was not an aspect which it gradually
acquired, by the accumulating contributions of experience,
but a feature of its original and native character.
<em>What</em> should happen universally, experience might be
needed to show: but that what happened should happen
<em>universally</em>, was implied in the nature of
knowledge. The universality of the laws of motion was not
gathered from experience, however much the laws themselves
might be so.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-3" href="#fnanchor39-3">39</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vi. c. v. sect. 2.</div>
<p id="b3c8s3">3. Thus we obtain the solution of our Paradox, so far as the
case before us is concerned. The laws of motion borrow their
<em>form</em> from the Idea of Causation, though their
<em>matter</em> may be given by experience: and hence they
possess a universality which experience cannot give. They
are certainly and universally valid; and the only question
for observation to decide is, how they are to be understood.
They are like general mathematical formulæ, which are known
to be true, even while we are ignorant what are the unknown
quantities which they involve. It must be allowed, on the
other hand, that so long as these formulæ are not
interpreted by a real study of nature, they are not only
useless but prejudicial; filling men’s minds with vague
general terms, empty maxims, and unintelligible
abstractions, which they mistake for knowledge. Of such
perversion of the speculative propensities of man’s nature,
the world has seen too much in all ages. Yet we must not, on
that account, despise these forms of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page268">268</a></span> truth, since
without them, no general knowledge is possible. Without
general terms, and maxims, and abstractions, we can have no
science, no speculation; hardly, indeed, consistent thought
or the exercise of reason. The course of real knowledge is,
to obtain from thought and experience the right
interpretation of our general terms, the real import of our
maxims, the true generalizations which our abstractions
involve.</p>
<p id="b3c8s4">4. If it be asked, How Experience is able to teach us to
interpret aright the general terms which the Axioms of
Causation involve;&#8212;whence she derives the light which she
is to throw on these general notions; the answer is
obvious;&#8212;namely, that the relations of causation are the
<em>conditions</em> of Experience;&#8212;that the general notions
are <em>exemplified</em> in the particular cases of which
she takes cognizance. The events which take place about us,
and which are the objects of our observation, we cannot
conceive otherwise than as subject to the laws of cause and
effect. Every event must have a cause;&#8212;Every effect must be
determined by its cause;&#8212;these maxims are true of the
phenomena which form the materials of our experience. It is
precisely to them, that these truths apply. It is in the
world which we have before our eyes, that these propositions
are universally verified; and it is therefore by the
observation of what we see, that we must learn how these
propositions are to be understood. Every fact, every
experiment, is an example of these statements; and it is
therefore by attention to and familiarity with facts and
experiments, that we learn the signification of the
expressions in which the statements are made; just as in any
other case we learn the import of language by observing the
manner in which it is applied in known cases. Experience is
the interpreter of nature; it being understood that she is
to make her interpretation in that comprehensive phraseology
which is the genuine language of science.</p>
<p id="b3c8s5">5. We may return for an instant to the objection, that
experience cannot give us general truths, since, after any
number of trials confirming a rule, we may for aught we can
foresee, have one which violates the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page269">269</a></span> rule. When we
have seen a thousand stones fall to the ground, we may see
one which does not fall under the same apparent
circumstances. How then, it is asked, can experience teach
us that <em>all</em> stones, rigorously speaking, will fall
if unsupported? And to this we reply, that it is not true
that we can conceive one stone to be suspended in the air,
while a thousand others fall, without believing some
peculiar cause to support it; and that, therefore, such a
supposition forms no exception to the law, that gravity is a
force by which <em>all</em> bodies are urged downwards.
Undoubtedly we can conceive a body, when dropt or thrown, to
move in a line quite different from other bodies: thus a
certain missile<a id="fnanchor40-3" href="#note40-3"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a> used by the natives of Australia, and
lately brought to this country, when thrown from the hand in
a proper manner, describes a curve, and returns to the place
from whence it was thrown. But did any one, therefore, even
for an instant suppose that the laws of motion are different
for this and for other bodies? On the contrary, was not
every person of a speculative turn immediately led to
inquire how it was that the known causes which modify
motion, the resistance of the air and the other causes,
produced in this instance so peculiar an effect? And if the
motion had been still more unaccountable, it would not have
occasioned any uncertainty whether it were consistent with
the agency of gravity and the laws of motion. If a body
suddenly alter its direction, or move in any other
unexpected manner, we never doubt that there is a cause of
the change. We may continue quite ignorant of the nature of
this cause, but this ignorance never occasions a moment’s
doubt that the cause exists and is exactly suited to the
effect. And thus experience can prove or discover to us
general rules, but she can never prove that general rules do
not exist. Anomalies, exceptions, unexplained phenomena, may
remind us that we have much still to learn, but they can
never make us suppose that truths are not universal. We may
observe facts that show us we have not fully <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page270">270</a></span>
understood the meaning of our general laws, but we can never
find facts which show our laws to have no meaning. Our
experience is bound in by the limits of cause and effect,
and can give us no information concerning any region where
that relation does not prevail. The whole series of external
occurrences and objects, through all time and space, exists
only, and is conceived only, as subject to this relation;
and therefore we endeavour in vain to imagine to ourselves
when and where and how exceptions to this relation may
occur. The assumption of the connexion of cause and effect
is essential to our experience, as the recognition of the
maxims which express this connexion is essential to our
knowledge.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note40-3" href="#fnanchor40-3">40</a></span> Called the Bo-me-rang.</div>
<p id="b3c8s6">6. I have thus endeavoured to explain in some measure how,
at least in the field of our mechanical knowledge,
experience can discover universal truths, though she cannot
give them their universality; and how such truths, though
borrowing their form from our ideas, cannot be understood
except by the actual study of external nature. And thus with
regard to the laws of motion, and other fundamental
principles of Mechanics, the analysis of our ideas and the
history of the progress of the science well illustrate each
other.</p>
<p>If the paradox of the discovery of universal truths by
experience be thus solved in one instance, a much wider
question offers itself to us;&#8212;How far the difficulty, and
how far the solution, are applicable to other subjects. It
is easy to see that this question involves most grave and
extensive doctrines with regard to the whole compass of
human knowledge: and the views to which we have been led in
the present Book of this work are, we trust, fitted to throw
much light upon the general aspect of the subject. But after
discussions so abstract, and perhaps obscure, as those in
which we have been engaged for some chapters, I willingly
postpone to a future occasion an investigation which may
perhaps appear to most readers more recondite and difficult
still. And we have, in fact, many other special fields of
knowledge to survey, before we are led by the order of our
subject, to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page271">271</a></span> those general questions and doctrines,
those antitheses brought into view and again resolved, which
a view of the whole territory of human knowledge suggests,
and by which the nature and conditions of knowledge are
exhibited.</p>
<p>Before we quit the subject of mechanical science we shall
make a few remarks on another doctrine which forms part of
the established truths of the science, namely, the doctrine
of universal gravitation.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page272"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Establishment of the Law of Universal Gravitation.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="drop" id="b3c9s1"><span class="sc">THE</span> doctrine of universal gravitation is a feature of so
much importance in the history of science that we shall not
pass it by without a few remarks on the nature and evidence
of the doctrine.</p>
<p>1. To a certain extent the doctrine of the attraction of
bodies according to the law of the inverse square of the
distance, exhibits in its progress among men the same
general features which we have noticed in the history of the
laws of motion. This doctrine was maintained <i>à priori</i>
on the ground of its simplicity, and was asserted
positively, even before it was clearly
understood:&#8212;notwithstanding this anticipation, its
establishment on the ground of facts was a task of vast
labour and sagacity:&#8212;when it had been so established in a
general way, there occurred at later periods, an occasional
suspicion that it might be approximately true only:&#8212;these
suspicions led to further researches, which showed the rule
to be rigorously exact:&#8212;and at present there are
mathematicians who maintain, not only that it is true, but
that it is a necessary property of matter. A very few words
on each of these points will suffice.</p>
<p id="b3c9s2">2. I have shown in the <i>History of Science</i><a id="fnanchor41-3" href="#note41-3"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a>, that
the attraction of the sun according to the inverse square of
the distance, had been divined by Bullialdus, Hooke, Halley,
and others, before it was proved by Newton. Probably the
reason which suggested this conjecture was, that gravity
might be considered <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page273">273</a></span> as a sort of emanation; and that
thus, like light or any other effect diffused from a center,
it must follow the law just stated, the efficacy of the
force being weakened in receding from the center, exactly in
proportion to the space through which it is diffused. It
cannot be denied that such a view appears to be strongly
recommended by analogy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-3" href="#fnanchor41-3">41</a></span> B. vii. c. i.</div>
<p>When it had been proved by Newton that the planets were
really retained in their elliptical orbits by a central
force, his calculations also showed that the above-stated
<em>law</em> of the force must be at least very approximately
correct, since otherwise the aphelia of the orbits could not
be so nearly at rest as they were. Yet when it seemed as if
the motion of the moon’s apogee could not be accounted for
without some new supposition, the <i>à priori</i> argument
in favour of the inverse square did not prevent Clairaut
from trying the hypothesis of a small term added to that
which expressed the ancient law: but when, in order to test
the accuracy of this hypothesis, the calculation of the
motion of the moon’s apogee was pushed to a greater degree
of exactness than had been obtained before, it was found
that the new term vanished of itself; and that the inverse
square now accounted for the whole of the motion. And thus,
as in the case of the second law of motion, the most
scrupulous examination terminated in showing the simplest
rule to be rigorously true.</p>
<p id="b3c9s3">3. Similar events occurred in the history of another part of
the law of gravitation: namely, that the attraction is
proportional to the quantity of matter attracted. This part
of the law may also be thus stated, That the weight of
bodies arising from gravity is proportional to their
inertia; and thus, that the <em>accelerating force</em> on
all bodies under the same circumstances is the same. Newton
made experiments which proved this with regard to
terrestrial bodies; for he found that, at the end of equal
strings, balls of all substances, gold, silver, lead, glass,
wood, &amp;c., oscillated in equal times<a id="fnanchor42-3" href="#note42-3"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a>. But a few years
ago, doubts <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page274">274</a></span> arose among the German astronomers whether
this law was rigorously true with regard to the planetary
bodies. Some calculations appeared to prove, that the
attraction of Jupiter as shown by the perturbations which he
produces in the small planets Juno, Vesta, and Pallas, was
different from the attraction which he exerts on his own
satellites. Nor did there appear to these philosophers
anything inconceivable in the supposition that the
attraction of a planet might be thus <em>elective</em>. But
when Mr. Airy obtained a more exact determination of the
mass of Jupiter, as indicated by his effect on his
satellites, it was found that this suspicion was unfounded;
and that there was, in this case, no exception to the
universality of the rule, that this cosmical attraction is
in the proportion of the attracted mass.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-3" href="#fnanchor42-3">42</a></span> <i>Prin.</i> lib. iii. prop. 6.</div>
<p id="b3c9s4">4. Again: when it had thus been shown that a mutual
attraction of parts, according to the law above mentioned,
prevailed throughout the extent of the solar system, it
might still be doubted whether the same law extended to
other regions of the universe. It might have been perhaps
imagined that each fixed star had its peculiar law of force.
But the examination of the motions of double stars about
each other, by the two Herschels and others, appears to show
that these bodies describe ellipses as the planets do; and
thus extends the law of the inverse squares to parts of the
universe immeasurably distant from the whole solar system.</p>
<p id="b3c9s5">5. Since every doubt which has been raised with regard to
the universality and accuracy of the law of gravitation, has
thus ended in confirming the rule, it is not surprizing that
men’s minds should have returned with additional force to
those views which had at first represented the law as a
necessary truth, capable of being established by reason
alone. When it had been proved by Newton that gravity is
really a <em>universal</em> attribute of matter as far as we
can learn, his pupils were not content without maintaining
it to be an <em>essential</em> quality. This is the doctrine
held by Cotes in the preface to the second edition of the
<i>Principia</i> (1712): <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page275">275</a></span> ‘Gravity,’ he says, ‘is a
primary quality of bodies, as extension, mobility, and
impenetrability are.’ But Newton himself by no means went so
far. In his second Letter to Bentley (1693), he says, ‘You
sometimes speak of gravity as essential and inherent to
matter; pray do not ascribe that notion to me. The cause of
gravity,’ he adds, ‘I do not pretend to know, and would take
more time to consider of it.’</p>
<p>Cotes maintains his opinion by urging, that we learn by
<em>experience</em> that all bodies possess gravity, and
that we do not learn in any other way that they are
extended, moveable, or solid. But we have already seen, that
the ideas of space, time, and reaction, on which depend
extension, mobility, and solidity, are not results, but
conditions, of experience. We cannot conceive a body except
as extended; we cannot conceive it to exert mechanical
action except with some kind of solidity. But so far as our
conceptions of body have hitherto been developed, we find no
difficulty in conceiving two bodies which do not attract
each other.</p>
<p id="b3c9s6">6. Newton lays down, in the second edition of the
<i>Principia</i>, this ‘Rule of Philosophizing’ (book iii.);
that ‘The qualities of bodies which cannot be made more or
less intense, and which belong to all bodies on which we are
able to make experiments, are to be held to be qualities of
all bodies in general.’ And this Rule is cited in the sixth
Proposition of the Third Book of the <i>Principia</i>, (Cor.
2,) in order to prove that gravity, proportional to the
quantity of matter, may be asserted to be a quality of all
bodies universally. But we may remark that a Rule of
Philosophizing, itself of precarious authority, cannot
authorize us in ascribing universality to an empirical
result. Geometrical and statical properties are seen to be
necessary, and <em>therefore</em> universal: but Newton
appears disposed to assert a like universality of gravity,
quite unconnected with any necessity. It would be a very
inadequate statement, indeed a false representation, of
statical truth, if we were to say, that because every body
which has hitherto been tried <em>has been found</em> to
have a center of gravity, we venture to assert that all
bodies whatever <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page276">276</a></span> have a center of gravity. And if we
are ever able to assert the absolute universality of the law
of gravitation, we shall have to rest this truth upon the
clearer development of our ideas of matter and force; not
upon a Rule of Philosophizing, which, till otherwise proved,
must be a mere rule of prudence, and which the opponent may
refuse to admit.</p>
<p id="b3c9s7">7. Other persons, instead of asserting gravity to be in its
own nature essential to matter, have made hypotheses
concerning some mechanism or other, by which this mutual
attraction of bodies is produced<a id="fnanchor43-3" href="#note43-3"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a>. Thus the Cartesians
ascribed to a vortex the tendency of bodies to a center;
Newton himself seems to have been disposed to refer this
tendency to the elasticity of an ether; Le Sage propounded a
curious hypothesis, in which this attraction is accounted
for by the impulse of infinite streams of particles flowing
constantly through the universe in all directions. In these
speculations, the force of gravity is resolved into the
pressure or impulse of solids or fluids. On the other hand,
hypotheses have been propounded, in which the solidity, and
other physical qualities of bodies, have been explained by
representing the bodies as a collection of points, from
which points, repulsive, as well as attractive, forces
emanate. This view of the constitution of bodies was
maintained and developed by Boscovich, and is hence termed
‘Boscovich’s Theory:’ and the discussion of it will more
properly come under our review at a future period, when we
speak of the question whether bodies are made up of atoms.
But we may observe, that Newton himself appears to have
inclined, as his followers certainly did, to this mode of
contemplating the physical properties of bodies. In his
Preface to the <i>Principia</i>, after speaking of the
central forces which are exhibited in cosmical phenomena, he
says: ‘Would that we could derive the other phenomena of
Nature from mechanical principles by the same mode of
reasoning. For many things move me <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page277">277</a></span> so that I suspect
all these phenomena may depend upon certain forces, by which
the particles of bodies, through causes not yet known, are
either impelled to each other and cohere according to
regular figures, or are repelled and recede from each other:
which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto made
their attempts upon nature in vain.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-3" href="#fnanchor43-3">43</a></span> See Vince, <i>Observations on the Hypothesis
respecting Gravitation</i>, and the Critique of that work,
<i>Edinb. Rev.</i> vol. xiii.</div>
<p id="b3c9s8">8. But both these hypotheses;&#8212;that by which cohesion and
solidity are reduced to attractive and repulsive forces, and
that by which attraction is reduced to the impulse and
pressure of media;&#8212;are hitherto merely modes of
representing mechanical laws of nature; and cannot, either
of them, be asserted as possessing any evident truth or
peremptory authority to the exclusion of the other. This
consideration may enable us to estimate the real weight of
the difficulty felt in assenting to the mutual attraction of
bodies not in contact with each other; for it is often urged
that this attraction of bodies at a distance is an absurd
supposition.</p>
<p>The doctrine is often thus stigmatized, both by popular and
by learned writers. It was long received as a maxim in
philosophy (as Monboddo informs us<a id="fnanchor44-3" href="#note44-3"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a>), that a body
cannot act <em>where</em> it is not, any more than
<em>when</em> it is not. But to this we reply, that time is
a necessary condition of our conception of causation, in a
different manner from space. The action of force can only be
conceived as taking place in a succession of moments, in
each of which cause and effect immediately succeed each
other: and thus the interval of time between a cause and its
remote effect is filled up by a continuous succession of
events connected by the same chain of causation. But in
space, there is no such visible necessity of continuity; the
action and reaction may take place at a distance from each
other; all that is necessary being that they be equal and
opposite.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-3" href="#fnanchor44-3">44</a></span> <i>Ancient Metaphysics</i>, vol. ii. p. 175.</div>
<p>Undoubtedly the existence of attraction is rendered more
acceptable to common apprehension by supposing <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page278">278</a></span> some
intermediate machinery,&#8212;a cord, or rod, or fluid,&#8212;by which
the forces may be conveyed from one point to another. But
such images are rather fitted to satisfy those prejudices
which arise from the earlier application of our ideas of
force, than to exhibit the real nature of those ideas. If we
suppose two bodies to pull each other by means of a rod or
cord, we only suppose, in addition to those equal and
opposite forces acting upon the two bodies, (which forces
are alone essential to mutual attraction) a certain power of
resisting transverse pressure at every point of the
intermediate line: which additional supposition is entirely
useless, and quite unconnected with the essential conditions
of the case. When the Newtonians were accused of introducing
into philosophy an unknown cause which they termed
<i>attraction</i>, they justly replied that they knew as
much respecting attraction as their opponents did about
impulse. In each case we have a knowledge of the conception
in question so far as we clearly apprehend it under the
conditions of those axioms of mechanical causation which
form the basis of our science on such subjects.</p>
<p>Having thus examined the degree of certainty and generality
to which our knowledge of the law of universal gravitation
has been carried, by the progress of mechanical discovery
and speculation up to the present time, we might proceed to
the other branches of science, and examine in like manner
their grounds and conditions. But before we do this, it will
be worth our while to attend for a moment to the effect
which the progress of mechanical ideas among mathematicians
and mechanical philosophers has produced upon the minds of
other persons, who share only in an indirect and derivative
manner in the influence of science.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the general Diffusion of clear Mechanical Ideas.</span></h3>

<p class="noind" id="b3c10s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>E
have seen how the progress of knowledge upon the
subject of motion and force has produced, in the course of
the world’s history, a great change in the minds of acute
and speculative men; so that such persons can now reason
with perfect steadiness and precision upon subjects on
which, at first, their thoughts were vague and confused; and
can apprehend, as truths of complete certainty and evidence,
laws which it required great labour and time to discover.
This <em>complete</em> development and clear manifestation
of mechanical ideas has taken place only among
mathematicians and philosophers. But yet a progress of
thought upon such subjects,&#8212;an advance from the obscure to
the clear, and from errour to truth,&#8212;may be traced in the
world at large, and among those who have not directly
cultivated the exact sciences. This diffused and collateral
influence of science manifests itself, although in a
wavering and fluctuating manner, by various indications, at
various periods of literary history. The opinions and
reasonings which are put forth upon mechanical subjects, and
above all, the adoption, into common language, of terms and
phrases belonging to the prevalent mechanical systems,
exhibit to us the most profound discoveries and speculations
of philosophers in their effect upon more common and
familiar trains of thought. This effect is by no means
unimportant, and we shall point out some examples of such
indications as we have mentioned.</p>
<p id="b3c10s2">2. The discoveries of the ancients in speculative mechanics
were, as we have seen, very scanty; and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page280">280</a></span> hardly
extended their influence to the unmathematical world. Yet
the familiar use of the term ‘center of gravity’ preserved
and suggested the most important part of what the Greeks had
to teach. The other phrases which they employed, as
<i>momentum</i>, <i>energy</i>, <i>virtue</i>, <i>force</i>,
and the like, never had any exact meaning, even among
mathematicians; and therefore never, in the ancient world,
became the means of suggesting just habits of thought. I
have pointed out, in the History of Science, several
circumstances which appear to denote the general confusion
of ideas which prevailed upon mechanical subjects during the
times of the Roman empire. I have there taken as one of the
examples of this confusion, the fable narrated by Pliny and
others concerning the echineïs, a small fish, which was said
to stop a ship merely by sticking to it<a id="fnanchor45-3" href="#note45-3"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a>. This story
was adduced as betraying the absence of any steady
apprehension of the equality of action and reaction; since
the fish, except it had some immoveable obstacle to hold by,
must be pulled forward by the ship, as much as it pulled the
ship backward. If the writers who speak of this wonder had
shown any perception of the necessity of a reaction, either
produced by the rapid motion of the fish’s fins in the
water, or in any other way, they would not be chargeable
with this confusion of thought; but from their expressions
it is, I think, evident that they saw no such
necessity<a id="fnanchor46-3" href="#note46-3"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a>. Their idea of mechanical action was not
sufficiently distinct to enable them to see the absurdity of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page281">281</a></span> supposing an intense pressure with no obstacle for it
to exert itself against.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-3" href="#fnanchor45-3">45</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. iv. c. i. sect. 2.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-3" href="#fnanchor46-3">46</a></span> See Prof. Powell, <i>On the Nature and Evidence
of the Laws of Motion</i>. <i>Reports of the Ashmolean
Society</i>. Oxford. 1837. Professor Powell has made an
objection to my use of this instance of confusion of
thought; the remark in the text seems to me to justify what
I said in the History. As an evidence that the fish was not
supposed to produce its effect by its muscular power acting
on the water, we may take what Pliny says, <i>Nat. Hist.</i>
xxxii. 1, ‘Domat mundi rabiem, nullo suo labore; non
retinendo, aut alio modo quam adhærendo:’ and also what he
states in another place (ix. 41), that when it is preserved
in pickle, it may be used in recovering gold which has
fallen into a deep well. All this implies adhesion alone,
with no conception of reaction.</div>
<p id="b3c10s3">3. We may trace, in more modern times also, indications of a
general ignorance of mechanical truths. Thus the phrase of
shooting at an object ‘point-blank,’ implies the belief that
a cannon-ball describes a path of which the first portion is
a straight line. This errour was corrected by the true
mechanical principles which Galileo and his followers
brought to light; but these principles made their way to
popular notice, principally in consequence of their
application to the motions of the solar system, and to the
controversies which took place respecting those motions.
Thus by far the most powerful argument against the reception
of the Copernican system of the universe, was that of those
who asked, Why a stone dropt from a tower was not left
behind by the motion of the earth? The answer to this
question, now universally familiar, involves a reference to
the true doctrine of the composition of motions. Again;
Kepler’s persevering and strenuous attempts<a id="fnanchor47-3" href="#note47-3"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a> to frame a
physical theory of the universe were frustrated by his
ignorance of the first law of motion, which informs us that
a body will retain its velocity without any maintaining
force. He proceeded upon the supposition that the sun’s
force was requisite to <em>keep up</em> the motion of the
planets, as well as to deflect and modify it; and he was
thus led to a system which represented the sun as carrying
round the planets in their orbits by means of a
<em>vortex</em>, produced by his revolution. The same
neglect of the laws of motion presided in the formation of
Descartes’ system of vortices. Although Descartes had
enunciated in words the laws of motion, he and his followers
showed that they had not the practical habit of referring to
these mechanical principles; and dared not trust the planets
to move in free space without some surrounding machinery to
support them<a id="fnanchor48-3" href="#note48-3"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-3" href="#fnanchor47-3">47</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. v. c. iv. and b. vii.
c. i.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-3" href="#fnanchor48-3">48</a></span> I have, in the History, applied to Descartes the
character which Bacon gives to Aristotle, ‘Audax simul et
pavidus:’ though he was bold enough to enunciate the laws of
motion without knowing them aright, he had not the courage
to leave the planets to describe their orbits by the agency
of those laws, without the machinery of contact.</div>
<p id="b3c10s4"><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page282">282</a></span> 4. When at last mathematicians, following Newton, had
ventured to consider the motion of each planet as a
mechanical problem not different in its nature from the
motion of a stone cast from the hand; and when the solution
of this problem and its immense consequences had become
matters of general notoriety and interest; the new views
introduced, as is usual, new terms, which soon became
extensively current. We meet with such phrases as ‘flying
off in the tangent,’ and ‘deflexion from the tangent;’ with
antitheses between ‘centripetal’ and ‘centrifugal force,’ or
between ‘projectile’ and ‘central force.’ ‘Centers of
force,’ ‘disturbing forces,’ ‘perturbations,’ and
‘perturbations of higher orders,’ are not unfrequently
spoken of: and the expression ‘to gravitate,’ and the term
‘universal gravitation,’ acquired a permanent place in the
language.</p>
<p>Yet for a long time, and even up to the present day, we find
many indications that false and confused apprehensions on
such subjects are by no means extirpated. Arguments are
urged against the mechanical system of the universe,
implying in the opponents an absence of all clear mechanical
notions. Many of this class of writers retrograde to
Kepler’s point of view. This is, for example, the case with
Lord Monboddo, who, arguing on the assumption that force is
requisite to maintain, as well as to deflect motion,
produced a series of attacks upon the Newtonian philosophy;
which he inserted in his <i>Ancient Metaphysics</i>,
published in 1779 and the succeeding years. This writer
(like Kepler), measures force by the velocity which the body
<em>has</em><a id="fnanchor49-3" href="#note49-3"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a>, not by that which it <em>gains</em>.
Such a use of language would prevent our obtaining any laws
of motion at all. Accordingly, the author, in the very next
page to that which I have just quoted, abandons this measure
of force, and, in curvilinear motion, measures <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page283">283</a></span> force
by ‘the fall from the extremity of the arc.’ Again; in his
objections to the received theory, he denies that
curvilinear motion is compounded, although his own mode of
considering such motion assumes this composition in the only
way in which it was ever intended by mathematicians. Many
more instances might be adduced to show that a want of
cultivation of the mechanical ideas rendered this
philosopher incapable of judging of a mechanical system.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-3" href="#fnanchor49-3">49</a></span> <i>Anc. Met.</i> vol. ii. b. v. c. vi. p. 413.</div>
<p>The following extract from the <i>Ancient Metaphysics</i>,
may be sufficient to show the value of the author’s
criticism on the subjects of which we are now speaking. His
object is to prove that there do not exist a centripetal and
a centrifugal force in the case of elliptical motion. ‘Let
any man move in a circular or elliptical line described to
him; and he will find no tendency in himself either to the
center or from it, much less both. If indeed he attempt to
make the motion with great velocity, or if he do it
carelessly and inattentively, he may go out of the line,
either towards the center or from it: but this is to be
ascribed, not to the nature of the motion, but to our
infirmity; or perhaps to the animal form, which is more
fitted for progressive motion in a right line than for any
kind of curvilinear motion. But this is not the case with a
sphere or spheroid, which is equally adapted to motion in
all directions<a id="fnanchor50-3" href="#note50-3"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a>.’ We need hardly remind the reader that
the manner in which a man running round a small circle,
finds it necessary to lean inwards, in order that there may
be a centripetal inclination to counteract the centrifugal
force, is a standard example of our mechanical doctrines;
and this fact (quite familiar in practice as well as theory)
is in direct contradiction of Lord Monboddo’s assertion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-3" href="#fnanchor50-3">50</a></span> <i>Anc. Met.</i> vol. i. b. ii. c. 19, p. 264.</div>
<p id="b3c10s5">5. A similar absence of distinct mechanical thought appears
in some of the most celebrated metaphysicians of Germany. I
have elsewhere noted<a id="fnanchor51-3" href="#note51-3"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a> the opinion expressed by Hegel,
that the glory which belongs to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page284">284</a></span> Kepler has been
unjustly transferred to Newton; and I have suggested, as the
explanation of this mode of thinking, that Hegel himself, in
the knowledge of mechanical truth, had not advanced beyond
Kepler’s point of view. Persons who possess conceptions of
space and number, but who have not learnt to deal with ideas
of force and causation, may see more value in the
discoveries of Kepler than in those of Newton. Another
exemplification of this state of mind may be found in
Professor Schelling’s speculations; for instance, in his
<i>Lectures on the Method of Academical Study</i>. In the
twelfth Lecture, on the study of Physics and Chemistry, he
says, (p. 266,) ‘What the mathematical natural philosophy
has done for the knowledge of the laws of the universe since
the time that they were discovered by his (Kepler’s) godlike
genius, is, as is well known, this: it has attempted a
construction of those laws which, according to its
foundations, is altogether empirical. We may assume it as a
general rule, that in any proposed construction, that which
is not a pure general form cannot have any scientific import
or truth. The foundation from which the centrifugal motion
of the bodies of the world is derived, is no necessary form,
it is an empirical fact. The Newtonian attractive force,
even if it be a necessary assumption for a merely reflective
view of the subject, is still of no significance for the
Reason, which recognizes only absolute relations. The
grounds of the Keplerian laws can be derived, without any
empirical appendage, purely from the doctrine of Ideas, and
of the two Unities, which are in themselves one Unity, and
in virtue of which each being, while it is absolute in
itself, is at the same time in the absolute, and
reciprocally.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-3" href="#fnanchor51-3">51</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. vii. c. ii. sect. 5.</div>
<p>It will be observed, that in this passage our mechanical
laws are objected to because they are not necessary results
of our ideas; which, however, as we have seen, according to
the opinion of some eminent mechanical philosophers, they
are. But to assume this evident necessity as a condition of
every advance in science, is to mistake the last, perhaps
unattainable step, for the first, which lies before our
feet. And, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page285">285</a></span> without inquiring further about ‘the
Doctrine of the two Unities,’ or the manner in which from
that doctrine we may deduce the Keplerian laws, we may be
well convinced that such a doctrine cannot supply any
sufficient reason to induce us to quit the inductive path by
which all scientific truth up to the present time has been
acquired.</p>
<p id="b3c10s6">6. But without going to schools of philosophy opposed to the
Inductive School, we may find many loose and vague habits of
thinking on mechanical subjects among the common classes of
readers and reasoners. And there are some familiar modes of
employing the phraseology of mechanical science, which are,
in a certain degree, chargeable with inaccuracy, and may
produce or perpetuate confusion. Among such cases we may
mention the way in which the centripetal and centrifugal
forces, and also the projectile and central forces of the
planets, are often compared or opposed. Such antitheses
sometimes proceed upon the false notion that the two members
of these pairs of forces are of the same kind: whereas on
the contrary the <em>projectile</em> force is a hypothetical
impulsive force which may, at some former period, have
caused the motion to begin; while the <em>central</em> force
is an actual force, which must act continuously and during
the whole time of the motion, in order that the motion may
go on in the curve. In the same manner the
<em>centrifugal</em> force is not a distinct force in a
strict sense, but only a certain result of the first law of
motion, measured by the portion of <em>centripetal</em>
force which counteracts it. Comparisons of quantities so
heterogeneous imply confusion of thought, and often suggest
baseless speculations and imagined reforms of the received
opinions.</p>
<p id="b3c10s7">7. I might point out other terms and maxims, in addition to
those already mentioned, which, though formerly employed in
a loose and vague manner, are now accurately understood and
employed by all just thinkers; and thus secure and diffuse a
right understanding of mechanical truths. Such are
<i>momentum</i>, <i>inertia</i>, <i>quantity of matter</i>,
<i>quantity of motion</i>; that <i>force is proportional to
its effects</i>; that <i>action and</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page286">286</a></span> <i>reaction
are equal</i>; that <i>what is gained in force by machinery
is lost in time</i>; that <i>the quantity of motion in the
world cannot be either increased or diminished</i>. When the
expression of the truth thus becomes easy and simple, clear
and convincing, the meanings given to words and phrases by
discoverers glide into the habitual texture of men’s
reasonings, and the effect of the establishment of true
mechanical principles is felt far from the school of the
mechanician. If these terms and maxims are understood with
tolerable clearness, they carry the influence of truth to
those who have no direct access to its sources. Many an
extravagant project in practical machinery, and many a wild
hypothesis in speculative physics, has been repressed by the
general currency of such maxims as we have just quoted.</p>
<p id="b3c10s8">8. Indeed so familiar and evident are the elementary truths
of mechanics when expressed in this simple form, that they
are received as truisms; and men are disposed to look back
with surprise and scorn at the speculations which were
carried on in neglect of them. The most superficial reasoner
of modern times thinks himself entitled to speak with
contempt and ridicule of Kepler’s hypothesis concerning the
physical causes of the celestial motions: and gives himself
credit for intellectual superiority, because he sees, as
self-evident, what such a man could not discover at all. It
is well for such a person to recollect, that the real cause
of his superior insight is not the pre-eminence of his
faculties, but the successful labours of those who have
preceded him. The language which he has learnt to use
unconsciously, has been adapted to, and moulded on,
ascertained truths. When he talks familiarly of
“accelerating forces” and “deflexions from the tangent,” he
is assuming that which Kepler did not know, and which it
cost Galileo and his disciples so much labour and thought to
establish. Language is often called an instrument of
thought; but it is also the nutriment of thought; or rather,
it is the atmosphere in which thought lives: a medium
essential to the activity of our speculative power, although
invisible <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page287">287</a></span> and imperceptible in its operation; and an
element modifying, by its qualities and changes, the growth
and complexion of the faculties which it feeds. In this way
the influence of preceding discoveries upon subsequent ones,
of the past upon the present, is most penetrating and
universal, though most subtle and difficult to trace. The
most familiar words and phrases are connected by
imperceptible ties with the reasonings and discoveries of
former men and distant times. Their knowledge is an
inseparable part of ours; the present generation inherits
and uses the scientific wealth of all the past. And this is
the fortune, not only of the great and rich in the
intellectual world: of those who have the key to the ancient
storehouses, and who have accumulated treasures of their
own;&#8212;but the humblest inquirer, while he puts his
reasonings into words, benefits by the labours of the
greatest discoverers. When he counts his little wealth, he
finds that he has in his hands coins which bear the image
and superscription of ancient and modern intellectual
dynasties; and that in virtue of this possession,
acquisitions are in his power, solid knowledge within his
reach, which none could ever have attained to, if it were
not that the gold of truth, once dug out of the mine,
circulates more and more widely among mankind.</p>
<p id="b3c10s9">9. Having so fully examined, in the preceding instances, the
nature of the progress of thought which science implies,
both among the peculiar cultivators of science, and in that
wider world of general culture which receives only an
indirect influence from scientific discoveries, we shall not
find it necessary to go into the same extent of detail with
regard to the other provinces of human knowledge. In the
case of the Mechanical Sciences, we have endeavoured to
show, not only that Ideas are requisite in order to form
into a science the Facts which nature offers to us, but that
we can advance, almost or quite, to a complete
identification of the Facts with the Ideas. In the sciences
to which we now proceed, we shall not seek to fill up the
chasm by which Facts and Ideas are separated; but we shall
endeavour to detect the Ideas which our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page288">288</a></span> knowledge
involves, to show how essential these are; and in some
respects to trace the mode in which they have been gradually
developed among men.</p>
<p id="b3c10s10">10. The motions of the heavenly bodies, their laws, their
causes, are among the subjects of the first division of the
Mechanical Sciences; and of these sciences we formerly
sketched the history, and have now endeavoured to exhibit
the philosophy. If we were to take any other class of
motions, <em>their</em> laws and causes might give rise to
sciences which would be mechanical sciences in exactly the
same sense in which Physical Astronomy is so. The phenomena
of magnets, of electrical bodies, of galvanical apparatus,
seem to form obvious materials for such sciences; and if
they were so treated, the philosophy of such branches of
knowledge would naturally come under our consideration at
this point of our progress.</p>
<p>But on looking more attentively at the sciences of
Electricity, Magnetism, and Galvanism, we discover cogent
reasons for transferring them to another part of our
arrangement; we find it advisable to associate them with
Chemistry, and to discuss their principles when we can
connect them with the principles of chemical science. For
though the first steps and narrower generalizations of these
sciences depend upon mechanical ideas, the highest laws and
widest generalizations which we can reach respecting them,
involve chemical relations. The progress of these portions
of knowledge is in some respects opposite to the progress of
Physical Astronomy. In this, we begin with phenomena which
appear to indicate peculiar and various qualities in the
bodies which we consider, (namely, the heavenly bodies,) and
we find in the end that all these qualities resolve
themselves into one common mechanical property, which exists
alike in all bodies and parts of bodies. On the contrary, in
studying magnetical and electrical laws, we appear at first
to have a single extensive phenomenon, attraction and
repulsion: but in our attempts to generalize this
phenomenon, we find that it is governed by conditions
depending upon something quite separate from the bodies
themselves, upon <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page289">289</a></span> the presence and distribution of
peculiar and transitory agencies; and, so far as we can
discover, the general laws of these agencies are of a
<em>chemical</em> nature, and are brought into action by
peculiar properties of special substances. In cosmical
phenomena, everything, in proportion as it is referred to
mechanical principles, tends to simplicity,&#8212;to permanent
uniform forces,&#8212;to one common, positive, property. In
magnetical and electrical appearances, on the contrary, the
application of mechanical principles leads only to a new
complexity, which requires a new explanation; and this
explanation involves changeable and various
forces,&#8212;gradations and oppositions of qualities. The
doctrine of the universal gravitation of matter is a simple
and ultimate truth, in which the mind can acquiesce and
repose. We rank gravity among the mechanical attributes of
matter, and we see no necessity to derive it from any
ulterior properties. Gravity belongs to matter, independent
of any conditions. But the <em>conditions</em> of magnetic
or electrical activity require investigation as much as the
<em>laws</em> of their action. Of these conditions no mere
mechanical explanation can be given; we are compelled to
take along with us chemical properties and relations also:
and thus magnetism, electricity, galvanism, are
<i>mechanico-chemical sciences</i>.</p>
<p id="b3c10s11">11. Before considering these, therefore, I shall treat of
what I shall call <i>Secondary Mechanical Sciences</i>; by
which expression I mean the sciences depending upon certain
qualities which our senses discover to us in bodies;&#8212;<i>Optics</i>,
which has visible phenomena for its subject; <i>Acoustics</i>,
the science of hearing; the doctrine of <i>Heat</i>, a quality
which our touch recognizes: to this last science I shall take
the liberty of sometimes giving the name <i>Thermotics</i>,
analogous to the names of the other two. If our knowledge
of the phenomena of Smell and Taste had been successfully
cultivated and systematized, the present part of our work
would be the place for the philosophical discussion of those
sensations as the subjects of science.</p>
<p>The branches of knowledge thus grouped in one class involve
common Fundamental Ideas, from which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page290">290</a></span> their principles
are derived in a mode analogous, at least in a certain
degree, to the mode in which the principles of the
mechanical sciences are derived from the fundamental ideas
of causation and reaction. We proceed now to consider these
Fundamental Ideas, their nature, development, and
consequences.</p>

<span class="sc">Of the Idea of a Medium as commonly employed.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b4c1s1">1. <i>Of Primary and Secondary Qualities.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">In</span> the same
way in which the mechanical sciences depend upon the Idea of
Cause, and have their principles regulated by the
development of that Idea, it will be found that the sciences
which have for their subject Sound, Light, and Heat, depend
for <em>their</em> principles upon the Fundamental Idea of
Media by means of which we perceive those qualities. Like
the idea of cause, this idea of a medium is unavoidably
employed, more or less distinctly, in the common,
unscientific operations of the understanding; and is
recognized as an express principle in the earliest
speculative essays of man. But here also, as in the case of
the mechanical sciences, the development of the idea, and
the establishment of the scientific truths which depend upon
it, was the business of a succeeding period, and was only
executed by means of long and laborious researches,
conducted with a constant reference to experiment and
observation.</p>
<p>Among the most prominent manifestations of the influence of
the idea of a medium of which we have now to speak, is the
distinction of the qualities of bodies into
<em>primary</em>, and <em>secondary</em> qualities. This
distinction has <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page294">294</a></span> been constantly spoken of in modern
times: yet it has often been a subject of discussion among
metaphysicians whether there be really such a distinction,
and what the true difference is. Locke states it thus<a id="fnanchor1-4" href="#note1-4"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>:
Original or Primary qualities of bodies are ‘such as are
utterly inseparable from the body in what estate soever it
may be,&#8212;such as sense constantly finds in every particle of
matter which has bulk enough to be perceived, and the mind
finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less
than to make itself singly perceived by our senses:’ and he
enumerates them as solidity, extension, figure, motion or
rest, and number. Secondary qualities, on the other hand,
are such ‘which in truth are nothing in the objects
themselves, but powers to produce various sensations in us
by their primary qualities, <i>i.e.</i> by the bulk, figure,
texture, and motion of their insensible parts, as colours,
sounds, tastes, &amp;c.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-4" href="#fnanchor1-4">1</a></span> <i>Essay</i>, b. ii. ch. viii. s. 9, 10.</div>
<p>Dr. Reid<a id="fnanchor2-4" href="#note2-4"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>, reconsidering this subject, puts the
difference in another way. There is, he says, a real
foundation for the distinction of Primary and Secondary
qualities, and it is this: ‘That our senses give us a direct
and distinct notion of the primary qualities, and inform us
what they are in themselves; but of the secondary qualities,
our senses give us only a relative and obscure notion. They
inform us only that they are qualities that affect us in a
certain manner, that is, produce in us a certain sensation;
but as to what they are in themselves, our senses leave us
in the dark.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-4" href="#fnanchor2-4">2</a></span> <i>Essays</i>, b. ii. c. xvii.</div>
<p>Dr. Brown<a id="fnanchor3-4" href="#note3-4"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> states the distinction somewhat otherwise. We
give the name of Matter, he observes, to that which has
extension and resistance: these, therefore, are Primary
qualities of matter, because they compose our definition of
it. All other qualities are Secondary, since they are
ascribed to bodies only because we find them associated with
the primary qualities which form our notion of those bodies.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-4" href="#fnanchor3-4">3</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, ii. 12.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page295">295</a></span> It is not necessary to criticize very strictly these
various distinctions. If it were, it would be easy to find
objections to them. Thus Locke, it may be observed, does not
point out any <em>reason</em> for believing that his
secondary qualities are produced by the primary. How are we
to learn that the colour of a rose arises from the bulk,
figure, texture, and motion of its particles? Certainly our
senses do not teach us this; and in what other way, on
Locke’s principles, can we learn it? Reid’s statement is not
more free from the same objection. How does it appear that
our notion of Warmth is relative to our own sensations more
than our notion of Solidity? And if we take Brown’s account,
we may still ask whether our selection of certain qualities
to form our idea and definition of Matter be arbitrary and
without reason? If it be, how can it make a real
distinction? if it be not, what is the reason?</p>
<p>I do not press these objections, because I believe that any
of the above accounts of the distinction of Primary and
Secondary qualities is right in the main, however imperfect
it may be. The difference between such qualities as
Extension and Solidity on the one hand, and Colour or
Fragrance on the other, is assented to by all, with a
conviction so firm and indestructible, that there must be
some fundamental principle at the bottom of the belief,
however difficult it may be to clothe the principle in
words. That successive efforts to express the real nature of
the difference were made by men so clear-sighted and acute
as those whom I have quoted, even if none of them are
satisfactory, shows how strong and how deeply-seated is the
perception of truth which impels us to such attempts.</p>
<p>The most obvious mode of stating the difference of Primary
and Secondary qualities, as it naturally offers itself to
speculative minds, appears to be that employed by Locke,
slightly modified. Certain of the qualities of bodies, as
their bulk, figure, and motion, are perceived immediately in
the bodies themselves. Certain other qualities as sound,
colour, heat, are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page296">296</a></span> perceived by means of some medium.
Our conviction that this is the case is spontaneous and
irresistible; and this difference of qualities immediately
and mediately perceived is the distinction of Primary and
Secondary qualities. We proceed further to examine this
conviction.</p>
<p id="b4c1s2">2. <i>The Idea of Externality.</i>&#8212;In reasoning concerning
the Secondary Qualities of bodies, we are led to assume the
bodies to be external to us, and to be perceived by means of
some Medium intermediate between us and them. These
assumptions are fundamental conditions of perception,
inseparable from perception even in thought.</p>
<p>That objects are <em>external</em> to us, that they are
<em>without</em> us, that they have <em>outness</em>, is as
clear as it is that these words have any meaning at all.
This conviction is, indeed, involved in the exercise of that
faculty by which we perceive all things as existing in
space; for by this faculty we place ourselves and other
objects in one common space, and thus they are exterior to
us. It may be remarked that this apprehension of objects as
external to us, although it assumes the idea of space, is
far from being implied in the idea of space. The objects
which we contemplate are considered as existing in space,
and by that means become invested with certain mutual
relations of position; but when we consider them as existing
without <em>us</em>, we make the additional step of
supposing <em>ourselves</em> and the objects to exist in one
common space. The question respecting the Ideal Theory of
Berkeley has been mixed up with the recognition of this
condition of the externality of objects. That philosopher
maintained, as is well known, that the perceptible qualities
of bodies have no existence except in a perceiving mind.
This system has often been understood as if he had imagined
the world to be a kind of optical illusion, like the images
which we see when we shut our eyes, appearing to be without
us, though they are only in our organs; and thus this Ideal
System has been opposed to a belief in an external world. In
truth, however, no such opposition exists. The Ideal System
is an attempt to explain the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page297">297</a></span> mental process of
perception, and to get over the difficulty of mind being
affected by matter. But the author of that system did not
deny that objects were perceived under the conditions of
space and mechanical causation;&#8212;that they were
<em>external</em> and <em>material</em> so far as those
words describe perceptible qualities. Berkeley’s system,
however visionary or erroneous, did not prevent his
entertaining views as just, concerning optics or acoustics,
as if he had held any other doctrine of the nature of
perception.</p>
<p>But when Berkeley’s theory was understood as a denial of the
existence of objects without us, how was it answered? If we
examine the answers which are given by Reid and other
philosophers to this hypothesis, it will be found that they
amount to this: that objects <em>are</em> without us, since
we <em>perceive</em> that they are so; that we perceive them
to be external, by the same act by which we perceive them to
be objects. And thus, in this stage of philosophical
inquiry, the externality of objects is recognized as one of
the inevitable conditions of our perception of them; and
hence the Idea of Externality is adopted as one of the
necessary foundations of all reasoning concerning all
objects whatever.</p>
<p id="b4c1s3">3. <i>Sensation by a Medium.</i>&#8212;Objects, as we have just
seen, are necessarily apprehended as <em>without</em> us;
and in general, as removed from us by a great or small
distance. Yet they affect our bodily senses; and this leads
us irresistibly to the conviction that they are perceived by
means of something intermediate. Vision, or hearing, or
smell, or the warmth of a fire, must be communicated to us
by some Medium of Sensation. This unavoidable belief appears
in all attempts, the earliest and the latest alike, to
speculate upon such subjects. Thus, for instance, Aristotle
says<a id="fnanchor4-4" href="#note4-4"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>, ‘Seeing takes place in virtue of some action
which the sentient organ suffers: now it cannot suffer
action from the colour of the object directly: the only
remaining possible case then is, that it is acted upon by an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page298">298</a></span> intervening Medium; there must then be an intervening
Medium.’ ‘And the same may be said,’ he adds, ‘concerning
sounding and odorous bodies; for these do not produce
sensation by touching the sentient organ, but the
intervening Medium is acted on by the sound or the smell,
and the proper organ, by the Medium &#8230; In sound the Medium
is air; in smell we have no name for it.’ In the sense of
taste, the necessity of a Medium is not at first so
obviously seen, because the object tasted is brought into
contact with the organ; but a little attention convinces us
that the taste of a solid body can only be perceived when it
is conveyed in some liquid vehicle. Till the fruit is
crushed, and till its juices are pressed out, we do not
distinguish its flavour. In the case of heat, it is still
more clear that we are compelled to suppose some invisible
fluid, or other means of communication, between the distant
body which warms us and ourselves.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-4" href="#fnanchor4-4">4</a></span>  Περὶ Ψυχῆς. ii. 7. See the <a href="#motto">motto</a> to this Book.</div>
<p>It may appear to some persons that the assumption of an
intermedium between the object perceived and the sentient
organ results from the principles which form the basis of
our mechanical reasonings,&#8212;that every change must have a
cause, and that bodies can act upon each other only by
contact. It cannot be denied that this principle does offer
itself very naturally as the ground of our belief in media
of sensation; and it appears to be referred to for this
purpose by Aristotle in the passage quoted above. But yet we
cannot but ask, Does the principle, that matter produces its
effect by contact only, manifestly apply here? When we so
apply it, we include <em>sensation</em> among the
<em>effects</em> which material contact produces;&#8212;a case so
different from any merely mechanical effect, that the
principle, so employed, appears to acquire a new
signification. May we not, then, rather say that we have
here a new axiom,&#8212;That sensation implies a material cause
immediately acting on the organ,&#8212;than a new application of
our former proposition,&#8212;That all mechanical change implies
contact?</p>
<p>The solution of this doubt is not of any material
consequence to our reasonings; for whatever be the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page299">299</a></span>
ground of the assumption, it is certain that we do assume
the existence of media by which the sensations of sight,
hearing, and the like, are produced; and it will be seen
shortly that principles inseparably connected with this
assumption are the basis of the sciences now before us.</p>
<p>This assumption makes its appearance in the physical
doctrines of all the schools of philosophy. It is exhibited
perhaps most prominently in the tenets of the Epicureans,
who were materialists, and extended to all kinds of
causation the axiom of the existence of a corporeal
mechanism by which alone the effect is produced. Thus,
according to them, vision is produced by certain images or
material films which flow from the object, strike upon the
eyes, and so become sensible. This opinion is urged with
great detail and earnestness by Lucretius, the poetical
expositor of the Epicurean creed among the Romans. His
fundamental conviction of the necessity of a material medium
is obviously the basis of his reasoning, though he attempts
to show the existence of such a medium by facts. Thus he
argues<a id="fnanchor5-4" href="#note5-4"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>, that by shouting loud we make the throat sore;
which shows, he says, that the voice must be material, so
that it can hurt the passage in coming out.</p>

<p>Though the fundamental principles of several sciences depend
upon the assumption of a Medium of Perception, these
principles do not at all depend upon any special view of the
Process of our perceptions. The mechanism of that process is
a curious subject of consideration; but it belongs to
physiology, more properly than either to metaphysics, or to
those branches of physics of which we are now speaking. The
general nature of the process is the same for all the
senses. The object affects the appropriate intermedium; the
medium, through the proper organ, the eye, the ear, the
nose, affects the nerves of the particular sense; and, by
these, in some way, the sensation is conveyed to the mind,
But to treat the <em>impression</em> upon the nerves as the
<em>act</em> of sensation which we have to consider, would
be to mistake our object, which is not the constitution of
the human body, but of the human mind. It would be to
mistake one link of the chain for the power which holds the
end of the chain. No anatomical analysis of the corporeal
conditions of vision, or hearing, or feeling warm, is
necessary to the sciences of Optics, or Acoustics, or
Thermotics.</p>
<p>Not only is this physiological research an extraneous part
of our subject, but a partial pursuit of such a research may
mislead the inquirer. We perceive objects <em>by means
of</em> certain media, and <em>by means of</em> certain
impressions on the nerves: but we cannot with propriety say
that we perceive either the media or the impressions on the
nerves. What person in the act of seeing is conscious of the
little coloured spaces on the retina? or of the motions of
the bones of the auditory apparatus whilst he is hearing?
Surely, no one. This may appear obvious enough, and yet a
writer of no common acuteness, Dr. Brown, has put forth
several <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page301">301</a></span> very strange opinions, all resting upon the
doctrine that the coloured spaces on the retina are the
<em>objects</em> which we perceive; and there are some
supposed difficulties and paradoxes on the same subject
which have become quite celebrated (as upright vision with
inverted images), arising from the same confusion of
thought.</p>
<p>As the consideration of the difficulties which have arisen
respecting the Philosophy of Perception may serve still
further to illustrate the principles on which we necessarily
reason respecting the secondary qualities of bodies, I shall
here devote a few pages to that subject.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">On Peculiarities in the Perceptions of the Different Senses.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b4c2s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>E
cannot doubt that we perceive all secondary qualities
by means of immediate impressions made, through the proper
medium of sensation, upon our organs. Hence all the senses
are sometimes vaguely spoken of as modifications of the
sense of feeling. It will, however, be seen, on reflection,
that this mode of speaking identifies in words things which
in our conceptions have nothing in common. No impression on
the organs of touch can be conceived as having any
resemblance to colour or smell. No effort, no ingenuity, can
enable us to describe the impressions of one sense in terms
borrowed from another.</p>
<p>The senses have, however, each its peculiar powers, and
these powers may be in some respects compared, so as to show
their leading resemblances and differences, and the
characteristic privileges and laws of each. This is what we
shall do as briefly as possible.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> I.&#8212;<i>Prerogatives of Sight.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> sight distinguishes colours, as the hearing
distinguishes tones; the sight estimates degrees of
brightness, the ear, degrees of loudness; but with several
resemblances, there are most remarkable differences between
these two senses.</p>
<p id="b4c2s2">2. <i>Position.</i>&#8212;The sight has this peculiar
prerogative, that it apprehends the <em>place</em> of its
objects directly and primarily. We see <em>where</em> an
object is at the same instant that we see what it is. If we
see two objects, we see their relative position. We cannot
help <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page303">303</a></span> perceiving that one is above or below, to the
right or to the left of the other, if we perceive them at
all.</p>
<p>There is nothing corresponding to this in sound. When we
hear a noise, we do not necessarily assign a place to it. It
may easily happen that we cannot tell from which side a
thunder-clap comes. And though we often can judge in what
direction a voice is heard, this is a matter of secondary
impression, and of inference from concomitant circumstances,
not a primary fact of sensation. The judgments which we form
concerning the position of sounding bodies are obtained by
the conscious or unconscious comparison of the impressions
made on the two ears, and on the bones of the head in
general; they are not inseparable conditions of hearing. We
may hear sounds, and be uncertain whether they are ‘above,
around, or underneath!’ but the moment anything visible
appears, however unexpected, we can say, ‘see <em>where</em>
it comes!’</p>
<p>Since we can see the relative position of things, we can see
<em>figure</em>, which is but the relative position of the
different parts of the boundary of the object. And thus the
whole visible world exhibits to us a scene of various
shapes, coloured and shaded according to their form and
position, but each having relations of position to all the
rest; and altogether, entirely filling up the whole range
which the eye can command.</p>
<p id="b4c2s3">3. <i>Distance.</i>&#8212;The distance of objects from us is no
matter of immediate perception, but is a judgment and
inference formed from our sensations, in something of the
same way as our judgment of position by the ear, though more
precise. That this is so, was most distinctly shown by
Berkeley, in his <i>New Theory of Vision</i>. The elements
on which we form our judgment are, the effort by which we
fix both eyes on the same object, the effort by which we
adjust each eye to distinct vision, and the known forms,
colours, and parts of objects, as compared with their
appearance. The right interpretation of the information
which these circumstances give us respecting the true
distances and forms of things, is gradually learnt by
experience, the lesson being begun in our earliest infancy,
and inculcated upon us every hour during which we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page304">304</a></span> use
our eyes. The completeness with which the lesson is learnt
is truly admirable; for we forget that our conclusion is
obtained indirectly, and mistake a judgment on evidence for
an intuitive perception. This, however, is not more
surprizing than the rapidity and unconsciousness of effort
with which we understand the meaning of the speech that we
hear, or the book that we read. In both cases, the habit of
interpretation is become as familiar as the act of
perception. And this is the case with regard to vision. We
see the breadth of the street as clearly and readily as we
see the house on the other side of it. We see the house to
be square, however obliquely it be presented to us. Indeed
the difficulty is, to recover the consciousness of our real
and original sensations;&#8212;to discover what is the
<em>apparent</em> relation of the lines which appear before
us. As we have already said, (book ii. <a href="#b2c6s1">chap. 6</a>) in the
common process of vision we suppose ourselves to see that
which cannot be seen; and when we would make a picture of an
object, the difficulty is to represent what is visible and
no more.</p>
<p>But perfect as is our habit of interpreting what we
perceive, we could not interpret if we did not perceive. If
the eye did not apprehend visible position, it could not
infer actual position, which is collected from visible
position as a consequence: if we did not see apparent
figure, we could not arrive at any opinion concerning real
form. The perception of place, which is the prerogative of
the eye, is the basis of all its other superiority.</p>
<p>The precision with which the eye can judge of apparent
position is remarkable. If we had before us two stars
distant from each other by one-twentieth of the moon’s
diameter, we could easily decide the apparent direction of
the one from the other, as above or below, to the right or
left. Yet eight millions of stars might be placed in the
visible hemisphere of the sky at such distances from each
other; and thus the eye would recognize the relative
position in a portion of its range not greater than one
eight-millionth of the whole. Such is the accuracy of the
sense of vision in this <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page305">305</a></span> respect; and, indeed, we might
with truth have stated it much higher. Our judgment of the
position of distant objects in a landscape depends upon
features far more minute than the magnitude we have here
described.</p>
<p>As our object is to point out principally the differences of
the senses, we do not dwell upon the delicacy with which we
distinguish tints and shades, but proceed to another sense.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.&#8212;<i>Prerogatives of Hearing.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> sense of hearing has two remarkable prerogatives; it can
perceive a definite and peculiar relation between certain
tones, and it can clearly perceive two tones together; in
both these circumstances it is distinguished from vision,
and from the other senses.</p>
<p id="b4c2s4">4. <i>Musical intervals.</i>&#8212;We perceive that two tones
have, or have not, certain definite relations to each other,
which we call <i>Concords</i>: one sound is a <i>Fifth</i>,
an <i>Octave</i>, &amp;c., above the other. And when this is the
case, our perception of the relation is extremely precise.
It is easy to perceive when a fifth is out of tune by
one-twentieth of a tone; that is, by one-seventieth of
itself. To this there is nothing analogous in vision.
Colours have certain vague relations to one another; they
look well together, by contrast or by resemblance; but this
is an indefinite, and in most cases a casual and variable
feeling. The relation of <em>complementary</em> colours to
one another, as of red to green, is somewhat more definite;
but still, has nothing of the exactness and peculiarity
which belongs to a musical concord. In the case of the two
sounds, there is an exact point at which the relation
obtains; when by altering one note we pass this point, the
concord does not gradually fade away, but instantly becomes
a discord; and if we go further still, we obtain another
concord of quite a different character.</p>
<p>We learn from the theory of sound that concords occur when
the times of vibration of the notes have exact simple
ratios; an octave has these times as 1 to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page306">306</a></span> 2; a fifth,
as 2 to 3. According to the undulatory theory of light, such
ratios occur in colours, yet the eye is not affected by them
in any peculiar way. The times of the undulations of certain
red and certain violet rays are as 2 to 3, but we do not
perceive any peculiar harmony or connexion between those
colours.</p>
<p id="b4c2s5">5. <i>Chords.</i>&#8212;Again, the ear has this prerogative, that
it can apprehend two notes together, yet distinct. If two
notes, distant by a fifth from each other, are sounded on
two wind instruments, both they and their musical relation
are clearly perceived. There is not a mixture, but a
concord, a musical interval. In colours, the case is
otherwise. If blue and yellow fall on the same spot, they
form green; the colour is simple to the eye; it can no more
be decomposed by the vision than if it were the simple green
of the prismatic spectrum: it is impossible for us, by
sight, to tell whether it is so or not.</p>
<p>These are very remarkable differences of the two senses: two
colours can be compounded into an apparently simple one; two
sounds cannot: colours pass into each other by gradations
and intermediate tints; sounds pass from one concord to
another by no gradations: the most intolerable discord is
that which is near a concord. We shall hereafter see how
these differences affect the <i>scales</i> of sound and of
colour.</p>
<p id="b4c2s6">6. <i>Rhythm.</i>&#8212;We might remark, that as we see objects
in <em>space</em>, we hear sounds in <em>time</em>; and that
we thus introduce an arrangement among sounds which has
several analogies with the arrangement of objects in space.
But the conception of time does not seem to be peculiarly
connected with the sense of hearing; a faculty of
apprehending tone and time, or in musical phraseology
<i>tune</i> and <i>rhythm</i>, are certainly very distinct.
I shall not, therefore, here dwell upon such analogies.</p>
<p>The other Senses have not any peculiar prerogatives, at
least none which bear on the formation of science. I may,
however, notice, in the feeling of heat, this circumstance;
that it presents us with two opposites, heat and cold, which
graduate into each other. This <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page307">307</a></span> is not quite peculiar,
for vision also exhibits to us white and black, which are
clearly opposites, and which pass into each other by the
shades of gray.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> III.&#8212;<i>The Paradoxes of Vision.</i></h4>
<p id="b4c2s7">7. <i>First Paradox of Vision. Upright Vision.</i>&#8212;All our
senses appear to have this in common; That they act by means
of organs, in which a bundle of nerves receives the
impression of the appropriate medium of the sense. In the
construction of these organs there are great differences and
peculiarities, corresponding, in part at least, to the
differences in the information given. Moreover, in some
cases, as we have noted in the case of audible position and
visible distance, that which seems to be a perception is
really a judgment founded on perceptions of which we are not
directly aware. It will be seen, therefore, that with
respect to the peculiar powers of each sense, it may be
asked;&#8212;whether they can be explained by the construction of
the peculiar organ;&#8212;whether they are acquired judgments and
not direct perceptions;&#8212;or whether they are inexplicable in
either of these ways, and cannot, at present at least, be
resolved into anything but conditions of the intellectual
act of perception.</p>
<p>Two of these questions with regard to vision, have been much
discussed by psychological writers: the cause of our seeing
objects upright by inverted images on the retina; and of our
seeing single with two such images.</p>
<p>Physiologists have very completely explained the exquisitely
beautiful mechanism of the eye, considered as analogous to
an optical instrument; and it is indisputable that by means
of certain transparent lenses and humours, an inverted image
of the objects which are looked at is formed upon the
<em>retina</em>, or fine net-work of nerve, with which the
back of the eye is lined. We cannot doubt that the
impression thus produced on these nerves is essential to the
act of vision; and so far as we consider the nerves <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page308">308</a></span>
themselves to feel or perceive by contact, we may say that
they perceive this image, or the affections of light which
it indicates. But we cannot with any propriety say that
<em>we</em> perceive, or that our mind perceives, this
image; for we are not conscious of it, and none but
anatomists are aware of its existence: we perceive <em>by
means</em> of it.</p>
<p>A difficulty has been raised, and dwelt upon in a most
unaccountable manner, arising from the neglect of this
obvious distinction. It has been asked, how is it that we
see an object, a man for instance, upright, when the
immediate object of our sensation, the image of the man on
our retina, is inverted? To this we must answer, that we see
him upright <em>because</em> the image is inverted; that the
inverted image is the necessary means of seeing an upright
object. This is granted, and where then is the difficulty?
Perhaps it may be put thus: How is it that we do not judge
the man to be inverted, since the sensible image is so? To
this we may reply, that we have no notion of
<em>upright</em> or inverted, except that which is founded
on experience, and that all our experience, without
exception, must have taught us that such a sensible image
belongs to a man who is in an upright position. Indeed, the
contrary judgment is not conceivable; a man is upright whose
head is upwards and his feet downwards. But what are the
sensible images of <em>upwards</em> and <em>downwards</em>?
Whatever be our standard of up and down, the sensible
representation of <em>up</em> will be an image moving on the
retina towards the lower side, and the sensible
representation of <em>down</em> will be a motion towards the
upper side. The head of the man’s image is towards the image
of the sky, its feet are towards the image of the ground;
how then should it appear otherwise than upright? Do we
expect that the whole world should appear inverted? Be it
so: but if the whole be inverted, how is the relation of the
parts altered? Do we expect that we should think our own
persons in particular? This cannot be, for we look at them
as we do at other objects. Do we expect that things should
appear to fall <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page309">309</a></span> upwards? Surely not. For what do we
know of upwards, except that it is the direction in which
bodies do <em>not</em> fall? In short, the whole of this
difficulty, though it has in no small degree embarrassed
metaphysicians, appears to result from a very palpable
confusion of ideas; from an attempt at comparison of what
<em>we</em> see, with that which the retina feels, as if
they were separately presentable. It is a sufficient
explanation to say, that we do not see the image on the
retina, but see by <em>means</em> of it. The perplexity does
not require much more skill to disentangle, than it does to
see that a word written in <em>black</em> ink, may signify
<em>white</em><a id="fnanchor8-4" href="#note8-4"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-4" href="#fnanchor8-4">8</a></span> The explanation of our seeing objects erect when
the image is inverted has been put very simply, by saying,
‘We <em>call</em> that the <em>lower</em> end of an object
which is next the ground.’ The observer cannot look into his
own eye; he knows <em>by experience</em> what kind of image
corresponds to a man in an upright position. The anatomist
tells him that this image is <em>inverted</em>: but this
does not disturb the process of judging by experience. It
does not appear why any one should be perplexed at the
notion of seeing objects erect by means of inverted images,
rather than at the notion of seeing objects large by means
of small images; or cubical and pyramidal, by means of
images on a spherical surface; or green and red, by means of
images on a black surface. Indeed some persons have
contrived to perplex themselves with these latter questions,
as well as the first.<br/>
&#8195;The above explanation is not at all affected, as to its
substance, if we adopt Sir David Brewster’s expression, and
say that the <i>line of visible direction</i> is a line
passing through the center of the spherical surface of the
retina, and therefore of course perpendicular to the
surface. In speaking of ‘the inverted image,’ it has always
been supposed to be determined by such lines; and though the
point where they intersect may not have been ascertained
with exactness by previous physiologists, the philosophical
view of the matter was not in any degree vitiated by this
imperfection.</div>
<p id="b4c2s8">8. <i>Second Paradox of Vision. Single Vision.</i>&#8212;(1.)
<i>Small or Distant Objects.</i>&#8212;The other difficulty, why
with two images on the retina we see only one object, is of
a much more real and important kind. This effect is
manifestly limited by certain circumstances of a very
precise nature; for if we direct our eyes at an object which
is very near the eye, we see <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page310">310</a></span> all other objects double.
The fact is not, therefore, that we are incapable of
receiving two impressions from the two images, but that,
under certain conditions, the two impressions form one. A
little attention shows us that these conditions are, that
with both eyes we should look at the same object; and again,
we find that to look at an object with either eye, is to
direct the eye so that the image falls on or near a
particular point about the middle of the retina. Thus these
middle points in the two retinas correspond, and we see an
image single when the two images fall on the corresponding
points.</p>
<p>Again, as each eye judges of position, and as the two eyes
judge similarly, an object will be seen in the same place by
one eye and by the other, when the two images which it
produces are <em>similarly situated</em> with regard to the
<em>corresponding points</em> of the retina<a id="fnanchor9-4" href="#note9-4"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-4" href="#fnanchor9-4">9</a></span> The explanation of single vision with two eyes
may be put in another form. Each eye judges immediately of
the relative position of all objects within the field of its
direct vision. Therefore when we look with both eyes at a
<em>distant</em> prospect (so distant that the distance
between the eyes is small in comparison) the two prospects,
being similar collections of forms, will coincide
altogether, if a corresponding point in one and in the other
coincide. If this be the case, the two images of every
object will fall upon corresponding points of the retina,
and will appear single.<br/>
&#8195;If the two prospects seen by the two eyes do not exactly
coincide, in consequence of nearness of the objects, or
distortion of the eyes, but if they nearly coincide, the
stronger image of an object absorbs the weaker, and the
object is seen single; yet modified by the combination, as
will be seen when we speak of the single vision of near
objects. When the two images of an object are considerably
apart, we see it double.<br/>
&#8195;This explanation is not different in substance from the one
given in the text; but perhaps it is better to avoid the
assertion that the law of corresponding points is ‘a
distinct and original principle of our constitution,’ as I
had stated in the first edition. The simpler mode of stating
the law of our constitution appears to be to say, that each
eye determines similarly the position of objects; and that
when the positions of an object, as seen by the two eyes,
coincide (or nearly coincide) the object is seen single.</div>
<p>This is the Law of Single Vision, at least so far as regards
small objects; namely, objects so small that in
contemplating them we consider their position only, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page311">311</a></span>
and not their solid dimensions. Single vision in such cases
is a result of the law of vision simply: and it is a mistake
to call in, as some have done, the influence of habit and of
acquired judgments, in order to determine the result in such
cases.</p>
<p>To ascribe the apparent singleness of objects to the
impressions of vision corrected by the experience of
touch<a id="fnanchor10-4" href="#note10-4"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>, would be to assert that a person who had not
been in the habit of handling what he saw, would see all
objects double; and also, to assert that a person beginning
with the double world which vision thus offers to him,
would, by the continued habit of handling objects, gradually
and at last learn to see them single. But all the facts of
the case show such suppositions to be utterly fantastical.
No one can, in this case, go back from the habitual judgment
of the singleness of objects, to the original and direct
perception of their doubleness, as the draughtsman goes back
from judgments to perception, in representing solid
distances and forms by means of perspective pictures. No one
can point out any case in which the habit is imperfectly
formed; even children of the most tender age look at an
object with both eyes, and see it as one.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-4" href="#fnanchor10-4">10</a></span>  See Brown, vol. ii. p. 81.</div>
<p>In cases when the eyes are distorted (in squinting), one eye
only is used, or if both are employed, there is double
vision; and thus any derangement of the correspondence of
motion in the two eyes will produce double-sightedness.</p>
<p>Brown is one of those<a id="fnanchor11-4" href="#note11-4"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> who assert that two images
suggest a single object because we have <em>always
found</em> two images to belong to a single object. He urges
as an illustration, that the <em>two</em> words ‘he
conquered,’ by custom excite exactly the same notion as the
<em>one</em> Latin word ‘vicit;’ and thus that two visual
images, by the effect of habit, produce the same belief of a
single object as one tactual impression. But in order to
make this pretended illustration of any value, it ought to
be true that when a person has thoroughly learnt the Latin
language, he can no longer distinguish <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page312">312</a></span> any separate
meaning in ‘he’ and in ‘conquered.’ We can by no effort
perceive the double sensation, when we look <em>at</em> the object
with the two eyes. Those who squint, learn by habit to see
objects single: but the habit which they acquire is that of
attending to the impressions of one eye only at once, not of
combining the two impressions. It is obvious, that if each
eye spreads before us the same visible scene, with the same
objects and the same relations of place, then, if one object
in each scene coincide, the whole of the two visible
impressions will be coincident. And here the remarkable
circumstance is, that not only each eye judges for itself of
the relations of position which come within its field of
view; but that there is a superior and more comprehensive
faculty which combines and compares the two fields of view;
which asserts or denies their coincidence; which
contemplates, as in a relative position to one another,
these two visible worlds, in which all other relative
position is given. This power of confronting two sets of
visible images and figured spaces before a purely
intellectual tribunal, is one of the most remarkable
circumstances in the sense of vision.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-4" href="#fnanchor11-4">11</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, vol. ii. p. 81.</div>
<p id="b4c2s9">9. (2.) <i>Near Objects.</i>&#8212;We have hitherto spoken of the
singleness of objects whose images occupy corresponding
positions on the retina of the two eyes. But here occurs a
difficulty. If an object of moderate size, a small thick
book for example, be held at a little distance from the
eyes, it produces an image on the retina of each eye; and
these two images are perspective representations of the book
from different points of view, (the positions of the two
eyes,) and are therefore of different forms. Hence the two
images cannot occupy corresponding points of the retina
throughout their whole extent. If the central parts of the
two images occupy corresponding points, the boundaries of
the two wall not correspond. How is it then consistent with
the law above stated that in this case the object appears
single?</p>
<p>It may be observed, that the two images in such a case will
differ most widely when the object is not a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page313">313</a></span> mere
surface, but a solid. If a book, for example, be held with
one of its upright edges towards the face, the right eye
will see one side more directly than the left eye, and the
left eye will see another side more directly, and the
outline of the two images upon the two retinas will exhibit
this difference. And it may be further observed, that this
difference in the images received by the two eyes, is a
plain and demonstrative evidence of the solidity of the
object seen; since nothing but a solid object could (without
some special contrivance) produce these different forms of
the images in the two eyes.</p>
<p>Hence the absence of exact coincidence in the two images on
the retina is the necessary condition of the solidity of the
object seen, and must be one of the indications by means of
which our vision apprehends an object as solid. And that
this is so, Mr. Wheatstone has proved experimentally, by
means of some most ingenious and striking contrivances. He
has devised<a id="fnanchor12-4" href="#note12-4"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> an instrument (the <i>stereoscope</i>) by
which two images (drawn in outline) differing exactly as
much as the two images of a solid body seen near the face
would differ, are conveyed, one to one eye, and the other to
the other. And it is found that when this is effected, the
object which the images represent is not only seen single,
but is apprehended as solid with a clearness and reality of
conviction quite distinct from any impression which a mere
perspective representation can give.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-4" href="#fnanchor12-4">12</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1839.</div>
<p>At the same time it is found that the object is then only
apprehended as single when the two images are such as are
capable of being excited by one single object placed in
solid space, and seen by the two eyes. If the images differ
more or otherwise than this condition allows, the result is,
that both are seen, their lines crossing and interfering
with one another.</p>
<p>It may be observed, too, that if an object be of such large
size as not to be taken in by a single glance of the eyes,
it is no longer apprehended as single by a direct act of
perception; but its parts are looked at <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page314">314</a></span> separately and
successively, and the impressions thus obtained are put
together by a succeeding act of the mind. Hence the objects
which are directly seen as solid, will be of moderate size;
in which case it is not difficult to show that the outlines
of the two images will differ from each other only slightly.</p>
<p>Hence we are led to the following, as the Law of Single
Vision for <em>near</em> objects:&#8212;When the two images in
the two eyes are situated (part for part) nearly, but not
exactly, upon corresponding points, the object is
apprehended as single, if the two images are such as are or
would be given by a single solid object seen by the two eyes
separately: and in this case the object is necessarily
apprehended as solid.</p>
<p>This law of vision does not contradict that stated above for
distant objects: for when an object is removed to a
considerable distance, the images in the two eyes coincide
exactly, and the object is seen as single, though without
any direct apprehension of its solidity. The first law is a
special case of the second. Under the condition of
<em>exactly</em> corresponding points, we have the
perception of singleness, but no evidence of solidity. Under
the condition of <em>nearly</em> corresponding points, we
may have the perception of singleness, and with it, of
solidity.</p>
<p>We have before noted it as an important feature in our
visual perception, that while we have two distinct
impressions upon the sense, which we can contemplate
separately and alternately, (the impressions on the two
eyes,) we have a higher perceptive faculty which can
recognize these two impressions, exactly similar to each
other, as only two images of one and the same assemblage of
objects. But we now see that the faculty by which we
perceive visible objects can do much more than this:&#8212;it can
not only unite two impressions, and recognize them as
belonging to one object in virtue of their coincidence, but
it can also unite and identify them, even when they do not
exactly coincide. It can correct and adjust their small
difference, so that they are both apprehended as
representations of the same figure. It can infer from them a
real form, not <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page315">315</a></span> agreeing with either of them; and a
solid space, which they are quite incapable of exemplifying.
The visual faculty decides whether or not the two ocular
images can be pictures of the same solid object, and if they
can, it undoubtingly and necessarily accepts them as being
so. This faculty operates as if it had the power of calling
before it all possible solid figures, and of ascertaining by
trial whether any of those will, at the same time, fit both
the outlines which are given by the sense. It assumes the
reality of solid space, and, if it be possible, reconciles
the appearances with that reality. And thus an activity of
the mind of a very remarkable and peculiar kind is exercised
in the most common act of seeing.</p>
<p id="b4c2s10">10. It may be said that this doctrine, of such a visual
faculty as has been described, is very vague and obscure,
since we are not told what are its limits. It adjusts and
corrects figures which <em>nearly</em> coincide, so as to
identify them. But <em>how</em> nearly, it may be asked,
must the figures approach each other, in order that this
adjustment may be possible? What discrepance renders
impossible the reconcilement of which we speak? Is it not
impossible to give a definite answer to these questions, and
therefore impossible to lay down definitely such laws of
vision as we have stated? To this I reply, that the
indefiniteness thus objected to us, is no new difficulty,
but one with which philosophers are familiar, and to which
they are already reconciled. It is, in fact, no other than
the indefiniteness of the limits of distinct vision. How
near to the face must an object be brought, so that we shall
cease to see it distinctly? The distance, it will be
answered, is indefinite: it is different for different
persons; and for the same person, it varies with the degree
of effort, attention, and habit. But this indefiniteness is
only the indefiniteness, in another form, of the deviation
of the two ocular images from one another: and in reply to
the question concerning them we must still say, as before,
that in doubtful cases, the power of apprehending an object
as single, when this <em>can</em> be done, will vary with
effort, attention, and habit. The assumption <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page316">316</a></span> that the
apparent object exists as a real figure, in real space, is
to be verified, if possible; but, in extreme cases, from the
unfitness of the point of view, or from any other cause of
visual confusion or deception, the existence of a real
object corresponding to the appearance may be doubtful; as
in any other kind of perception it may be doubtful whether
our senses, under disadvantageous circumstances, give us
true information. The vagueness of the limits, then, within
which this visual faculty can be successfully exercised, is
no valid argument against the existence of the faculty, or
the truth of the law which we have stated concerning its
action.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> IV.&#8212;<i>The Perception of Visible Figure.</i></h4>
<p id="b4c2s11">11. <i>Visible Figure.</i>&#8212;There is one tenet on the
subject of vision which appears to me so extravagant and
unphilosophical, that I should not have thought it necessary
to notice it, if it had not been recently promulgated by a
writer of great acuteness in a book which has obtained, for
a metaphysical work, considerable circulation. I speak of
Brown’s opinion<a id="fnanchor13-4" href="#note13-4"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a> that we have no immediate perception
of visible figure. I confess myself unable to comprehend
fully the doctrine which he would substitute in the place of
the one commonly received. He states it thus<a id="fnanchor14-4" href="#note14-4"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>: ‘When
the simple affection of sight is blended with the ideas of
suggestion [those arising from touch, &amp;c.] in what are
termed the acquired perceptions of vision, as, for example,
in the perception of a sphere, it is colour only which is
blended with the large convexity, and not a small coloured
plane.’ The doctrine which Brown asserts in this and similar
passages, appears to be, that we do not by vision perceive
<em>both</em> colour and <em>figure</em>; but that the
colour which we see is blended with the figure which we
learn the existence of by other means, as by touch. But if
this were possible when we can call in other perceptions,
how is it possible when we cannot or do not touch the
object? <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page317">317</a></span> Why does the moon appear round, gibbous, or
horned? What sense besides vision suggests to us the idea of
her figure? And even in objects which we can reach, what is
that circumstance in the sense of vision which suggests to
us that the colour belongs to the sphere, except that we see
the colour where we see the sphere? If we do not see figure,
we do not see position; for figure is the relative position
of the parts of a boundary. If we do not see position, why
do we ascribe the yellow colour to the sphere on our left,
rather than to the cube on our right? We <em>associate</em>
the colour with the object, says Dr. Brown; but if his
opinion were true, we could not associate two colours with
two objects, for we could not apprehend the colours as
occupying two different places.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-4" href="#fnanchor13-4">13</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, vol. ii. p. 82.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-4" href="#fnanchor14-4">14</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> vol. ii. p. 90.</div>
<p>The whole of Brown’s reasoning on this subject is so
irreconcilable with the first facts of vision, that it is
difficult to conceive how it could proceed from a person
who has reasoned with great acuteness concerning touch. In
order to prove his assertion, he undertakes to examine the
only reasons which, he says<a id="fnanchor15-4" href="#note15-4"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>, he can imagine for
believing the immediate perception of visible figure: (1)
That it is absolutely impossible, in our present sensations
of sight, to separate colour from extension; and (2) That
there are, in fact, figures on the retina corresponding to
the apparent figures of objects.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-4" href="#fnanchor15-4">15</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, vol. ii. p. 83.</div>
<p>On the subject of the first reason, he says, that the figure
which we perceive as associated with colour, is the real,
and not the apparent figure. ‘Is there,’ he asks, ‘the
slightest consciousness of a perception of visible figure,
corresponding to the affected portion of the retina?’ To
which, though he seems to think an affirmative answer
impossible, we cannot hesitate to reply, that there is
undoubtedly such a consciousness; that though obscured by
being made the ground of habitual inference as to the real
figure, this consciousness is constantly referred to by the
draughtsman, and easily recalled by any one. We may separate
colour, he says <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page318">318</a></span> again<a id="fnanchor16-4" href="#note16-4"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>, from the figures on the
retina, as we may separate it from length, breadth, and
thickness, which we do not see. But this is altogether
false: we cannot separate colour from length, breadth, and
thickness, <em>in any other way</em>, than by transferring
it to the visible figure which we do see. He cannot, he
allows, separate the colour from the visible form of the
trunk of a large oak; but just as little, he thinks, can he
separate it from the convex mass of the trunk, which (it is
allowed on all hands) he does not immediately see. But in
this he is mistaken: for if he were to make a
<em>picture</em> of the oak, he would separate the colour
from the convex shape, which he does not imitate, but he
could not separate it from the visible figure, which he does
imitate; and he would then perceive that the fact that he
<em>has not</em> an immediate perception of the convex form,
is necessarily connected with the fact that he <em>has</em>
an immediate perception of the apparent figure; so far is
the rejection of immediate perception in the former case
from being a reason for rejecting it in the latter.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-4" href="#fnanchor16-4">16</a></span> <i>Lectures</i>, vol. ii. p. 84.</div>
<p>Again, with regard to the second argument. It does not, he
says, follow, that because a certain figured portion of the
retina is affected by light, we should see such a figure;
for if a certain figured portion of the olfactory organ were
affected by odours, we should not acquire by smell any
perception of such figure<a id="fnanchor17-4" href="#note17-4"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>. This is merely to say, that
because we do not perceive position and figure by one sense,
we cannot do so by another sense. But this again is
altogether erroneous. It is an office of our sight to inform
us of position, and consequently of figure; for this
purpose, the organ is so constructed that the position of
the object determines the position of the point of the
retina affected. There is nothing of this kind in the organ
of smell; objects in different positions and of different
forms do not affect different parts of the olfactory nerve,
or portions of different shape. Different objects, remote
from each other, if perceived by smell, affect the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page319">319</a></span> part of the olfactory organs. This is all quite
intelligible; for it is not the office of smell to inform us
of position. Of what use or meaning would be the curious and
complex structure of the eye, if it gave us only such vague
and wandering notions of the colours and forms of the
flowers in a garden, as we receive from their odours when we
walk among them blindfold? It is, as we have said, the
<em>prerogative</em> of vision to apprehend position: the
places of objects on the retina give this information. We do
not suppose that the affection of a certain shape of nervous
expanse will necessarily and in all cases give us the
impression of figure; but we know that in vision it does;
and it is clear that if we did not acquire our acquaintance
with visible figure in this way, we could not acquire it in
any way<a id="fnanchor18-4" href="#note18-4"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-4" href="#fnanchor17-4">17</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 87.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-4" href="#fnanchor18-4">18</a></span> When Brown says further (p. 87), that we can
indeed show the image in the dissected eye; but that ‘it is
not in the dissected eye that vision takes place;’ it is
difficult to see what his drift is. Does he doubt that there
is an image formed in the living as completely as in the
dissected eye?</div>
<p>The whole of this strange mistake of Brown’s appears to
arise from the fault already noticed;&#8212;that of considering
the image on the retina as the <em>object</em> instead of
the <em>means</em> of vision. This indeed is what he says:
‘the true object of vision is not the distant body itself,
but the light that has reached the expansive termination of
the optic nerve<a id="fnanchor19-4" href="#note19-4"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>.’ Even if this were so, we do not see
why we should not perceive the position of the impression on
this expanded nerve. But as we have already said, the
impression on the nerve is the means of vision, and enables
us to assign a place, or at least a direction, to the object
from which the light proceeds, and thus makes vision
possible. Brown, indeed, pursues his own peculiar view till
he involves the subject in utter confusion. Thus he
says<a id="fnanchor20-4" href="#note20-4"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>, ‘According to the common theory [that figure can
be perceived by the eye,] a visible sphere is at once to my
perception convex and plane; and if the sphere be a one, it
is perceived at once to be a sphere of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page320">320</a></span> many feet in
diameter, and a plane circular surface of the diameter of a
quarter of an inch.’ It is easy to deduce these and greater
absurdities, if we proceed on his strange and baseless
supposition that the object and the image on the retina are
<em>both</em> perceived. But who is conscious of the image
on the retina in any other way than as he sees the object by
means of it?</p>

<p>Brown seems to have imagined that he was analysing the
perception of figure ‘in the same manner in which Berkeley
had analyzed the perception of distance. He ought to have
recollected that such an undertaking, to be successful,
required him to show <em>what</em> elements he analyzed it
<em>into</em>. Berkeley analyzed the perception of real
figure into the interpretation of visible figure according
to certain rules which he distinctly stated. Brown analyzes
the perception of visible figure into no elements. Berkeley
says, that we do not directly perceive distance, but that we
perceive something else, from which we infer distance,
namely, visible figure and colour, and our own efforts in
seeing; Brown says, that we do not see figure, but infer it;
what then do we see, which we infer it from? To this he
offers no answer. He asserts the seeming perception of
visible figure to be a result of ‘association;’&#8212;of
‘suggestion.’ But what meaning can we attach to this?
Suggestion requires something which suggests; and not a hint
is given what it is which suggests position. Association
implies two things associated; what is the sensation which
we associate with form? What is that visual perception which
is not figure, and which we mistake for figure? What
perception is it that suggests a square to the eye? What
impressions are those which have been associated with a
visible triangle, so that the revival of the impressions
revives the notion of the triangle? Brown has nowhere
pointed out such perceptions and impressions; nor indeed was
it possible for him to do so; for the only visual
perceptions which he allows to remain, those of colour, most
assuredly do not suggest visible figures by their
differences; red is not associated with square rather than
with round, or with round rather than square. On the
contrary, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page321">321</a></span> eye, constructed in a very complex and
wonderful manner in order that it may give to us directly
the perception of position as well as of colour, has it for
one of its prerogatives to give us this information; and the
perception of the relative position of each part of the
visible boundary of an object constitutes the perception of
its apparent figure; which faculty we cannot deny to the eye
without rejecting the plain and constant evidence of our
senses, making the mechanism of the eye unmeaning,
confounding the object with the means of vision, and
rendering the mental process of vision utterly
unintelligible.</p>
<p>Having sufficiently discussed the processes of perception, I
now return to the consideration of the Ideas which these
processes assume.</p>

what precedes, we have shown by various considerations
that we necessarily and universally assume the perception of
secondary qualities to take place by means of a medium
interjacent between the object and the person perceiving.
Perception is affected by various peculiarities, according
to the nature of the quality perceived: but in all cases a
medium is equally essential to the process.</p>
<p>This principle, which, as we have seen, is accepted as
evident by the common understanding of mankind, is confirmed
by all additional reflection and discipline of the mind, and
is the foundation of all the theories which have been
proposed concerning the processes by which the perception
takes place, and concerning the modifications of the
qualities thus perceived. The medium, and the mode in which
the impression is conveyed through the medium, seem to be
different for different qualities; but the existence of the
medium leads to certain necessary conditions or
alternatives, which have successively made their appearance
in science, in the course of the attempts of men to theorize
concerning the principal secondary qualities, sound, light,
and heat. We must now point out some of the ways, at first
imperfect and erroneous, in which the consequences of the
fundamental assumption were traced.</p>
<p id="b4c3s2">2. <i>Sound.</i>&#8212;In all cases the medium of sensation,
whatever it is, is supposed to produce the effect of
conveying secondary qualities to our perception by means of
its primary qualities. It was conceived to operate <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page323">323</a></span> by
the size, form, and motion of its parts. This is a
fundamental principle of the class of sciences of which we
have at present to speak.</p>
<p>It was assumed from the first, as we have seen in the
passage lately quoted from Aristotle<a id="fnanchor21-4" href="#note21-4"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>, that in the
conveyance of <em>sound</em>, the medium of communication
was the air. But although the first theorists were right so
far, that circumstance did not prevent their going entirely
wrong when they had further to determine the nature of the
process. It was conceived by Aristotle that the air acted
after the manner of a rigid body;&#8212;like a staff, which,
receiving an impulse at one end, transmits it to the other.
Now this is altogether an erroneous view of the manner in
which the air conveys the impulse by which sound is
perceived. An approach was made to the true view of this
process, by assimilating it to the diffusion of the little
circular waves which are produced on the surface of still
water when a stone is dropt into it. These little waves
begin from the point thus disturbed, and run outwards,
expanding on every side, in concentric circles, till they
are lost. The propagation of sound through the air from the
point where it is produced, was compared by Vitruvius to
this diffusion of circular waves in water; and thus the
notion of a propagation of impulse by the <em>waves</em> of
a fluid was introduced, in the place of the former notion of
the impulse of an unyielding body.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-4" href="#fnanchor21-4">21</a></span> <i>Supr.</i> <a href="#fnanchor4-4">p. 297</a>.</div>
<p>But though, taking an enlarged view of the nature of the
progress of a wave, this is a just representation of the
motion of air in conveying sound, we cannot suppose that the
process was, at the period of which we speak, rightly
understood. For the waves of water were contemplated only as
affecting the surface of the water; and as the air has no
surface, the communication must take place by means of an
internal motion, which can bear only a remote and obscure
resemblance to the waves which we see. And even with regard
to the waves of water, the mechanism by which they are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page324">324</a></span>
produced and transferred was not at all understood; so that
the comparison employed by Vitruvius must be considered
rather as a loose analogy than as an exact scientific
explanation.</p>
<p>No correct account of such motions was given, till the
formation of the science of Mechanics in modern times had
enabled philosophers to understand more distinctly the mode
in which motion is propagated through a fluid, and to
discern the forces which the process calls into play, so as
to continue the motion once begun. Newton introduced into
this subject the exact and rigorous conception of an
<em>Undulation</em>, which is the true key to the
explanation of impulses conveyed through a fluid.</p>
<p>Even at the present day, the right apprehension of the
nature of an Undulation transmitted through a fluid is found
to be very difficult for all persons except those whose
minds have been duly disciplined by mathematical studies.
When we see a wave run along the surface of water, we are
apt to imagine at first that a portion of the fluid is
transferred bodily from one place to another. But with a
little consideration we may easily satisfy ourselves that
this is not so: for if we look at a field of standing corn,
when a breeze blows over it, we see waves like those of
water run along its surface. Yet it is clear that in this
case the separate stalks of corn only bend backwards and
forwards, and no portion of the grain is really conveyed
from one part of the field to the other. This is obvious
even to popular apprehension. The poet speaks of</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">&#8195;.&#8195;.&#8195;.&#8195;.&#8195;The rye,</span><br/>
    <span class="i0">That stoops its head when whirlwinds rave</span><br/>
    <span class="i0">And springs again in eddying wave</span><br/>
    <span class="i0">As each wild gust sweeps by.</span><br/>
   </div>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">Each particle of the mass in succession has a small motion
backwards and forwards; and by this means a large ridge made
by many such particles runs along the mass to any distance.
This is the true conception of an undulation in general.</p>
<p>Thus, when an Undulation is propagated in a fluid, it is not
<em>matter</em>, but <em>form</em>, which is transmitted
from <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page325">325</a></span> one place to another. The particles along the
line of each wave assume a certain arrangement, and this
arrangement passes from one part to another, the particles
changing their places only within narrow limits, so as to
lend themselves successively to the arrangements by which
the successive waves, and the intervals between the waves,
are formed.</p>
<p>When such an Undulation is propagated through air, the wave
is composed, not, as in water, of particles which are higher
than the rest, but of particles which are closer to each
other than the rest. The wave is not a ridge of elevation,
but a line of condensation; and as in water we have
alternately elevated and depressed lines, we have in air
lines alternately condensed and rarefied. And the motion of
the particles is not, as in water, up and down, in a
direction transverse to that of the wave which runs
forwards; in the motion of an undulation through air the
motion of each particle is alternately forwards and
backwards, while the motion of the undulation is constantly
forwards.</p>
<p>This precise and detailed account of the Undulatory Motion
of air by which sound is transmitted was first given by
Newton. He further attempted to determine the motions of the
separate particles, and to point out the force by which each
particle affects the next, so as to continue the progress of
the undulation once begun. The motions of each particle must
be oscillatory; he assumed the oscillations to be governed
by the simplest law of oscillation which had come under the
notice of mathematicians, (that of small vibrations of a
pendulum;) and he proved that in this manner the forces
which are called into play by the contraction and expansion
of the parts of the elastic fluid are such as the
continuance of the motion requires.</p>
<p>Newton’s proof of the exact law of Oscillatory Motion of the
aërial particles was not considered satisfactory by
succeeding mathematicians; for it was found that the same
result, the development of forces adequate to continue the
motion, would follow if any other law of the motion were
assumed. Cramer proved this by a sort of <i>parody</i> on
Newton’s proof, in which, by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page326">326</a></span> alteration of a few
phrases in this formula of demonstration, it was made to
establish an entirely different conclusion.</p>
<p>But the general conception of an Undulation as presented by
Newton was, as from its manifest mechanical truth it could
not fail to be, accepted by all mathematicians; and in
proportion as the methods of calculating the motions of
fluids were further improved, the necessary consequences of
this conception, in the communication of sound through air,
were traced by unexceptionable reasoning. This was
especially done by Euler and Lagrange, whose memoirs on such
motions of fluids are some of the most admirable examples
which exist, of refined mathematical methods applied to the
solution of difficult mechanical problems.</p>
<p>But the great step in the formation of the theory of sound
was undoubtedly that which we have noticed, the introduction
of the Conception of an Undulation such as we have attempted
to describe it:&#8212;a state, condition, or arrangement of the
particles of a fluid, which is transferred from one part of
space to another by means of small motions of the particles,
altogether distinct from the movement of the Undulation
itself. This is a conception which is not obvious to common
apprehension. It appears paradoxical at first sight to speak
of a large <em>wave</em> (as the tide-wave) running up a
river at the rate of twenty miles an hour, while the
<em>stream</em> of the river is all the while flowing
downwards. Yet this is a very common fact. And the
conception of such a motion must be fully mastered by all
who would reason rightly concerning the mechanical
transmission of impressions through a medium.</p>
<p>We have described the motion of sound as produced by small
motions of the particle forwards and backwards, while the
waves, or condensed and rarefied lines, move constantly
forwards. It may be asked what right we have to suppose the
motion to be of this kind, since when sound is heard, no
such motions of the particles of air can be observed, even
by refined methods of observation. Thus Bacon declares
himself against the hypothesis of such a vibration, since,
as he remarks, it <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page327">327</a></span> cannot be perceived in any visible
impression upon the flame of a candle. And to this we reply,
that the supposition of this Vibration is made in virtue of
a principle which is involved in the original assumption of
a medium; namely, That <em>a Medium, in conveying Secondary
qualities, operates by means of its Primary qualities</em>,
the bulk, figure, motion, and other mechanical properties of
its parts. This is an Axiom belonging to the Idea of a
Medium. In virtue of this axiom it is demonstrable that the
motion of the air, when any how disturbed, must be such as
is supposed in our acoustical reasonings. For the elasticity
of the parts of the air, called into play by its expansion
and contraction, lead, by a mechanical necessity, to such a
motion as we have described. We may add that, by proper
contrivances, this motion may be made perceptible in its
visible effects. Thus the theory of sound, as an impression
conveyed through air, is established upon evident general
principles, although the mathematical calculations which are
requisite to investigate its consequences are, some of them,
of a very recondite kind.</p>
<p id="b4c3s3">3. <i>Light.</i>&#8212;The early attempts to explain Vision
represented it as performed by means of material rays
proceeding <em>from</em> the eye, by the help of which the
eye felt out the form and other visible qualities of an
object, as a blind man might do with his staff. But this
opinion could not keep its ground long: for it did not even
explain the fact that light is necessary to vision. Light,
as a peculiar medium, was next assumed as the machinery of
vision; but the mode in which the impression was conveyed
through the medium was left undetermined, and no advance was
made towards sound theory, on that subject, by the ancients.</p>
<p>In modern times, when the prevalent philosophy began to
assume a mechanical turn (as in the theories of Descartes),
light was conceived to be a material substance which is
emitted from luminous bodies, and which is also conveyed
from all bodies to the eye, so as to render them visible.
The various changes of direction by which the rays of light
are affected, (reflection, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page328">328</a></span> refraction, &amp;c.,) Descartes
explained, by considering the particles of light as small
globules, which change their direction when they impinge
upon other bodies, according to the laws of Mechanics.
Newton, with a much more profound knowledge of Mechanics
than Descartes possessed, adopted, in the most mature of his
speculations, nearly the same view of the nature of light;
and endeavoured to show that reflection, refraction, and
other properties of light, might be explained as the effects
which certain forces, emanating from the particles of
bodies, produce upon the luminiferous globules.</p>
<p>But though some of the properties of light could thus be
accounted for by the assumption of particles emitted from
luminous bodies, and reflected or refracted by forces, other
properties came into view which would not admit of the same
explanation. The phenomena of <i>diffraction</i> (the
fringes which accompany shadows) could never be truly
represented by such an hypothesis, in spite of many attempts
which were made. And the <i>colours of thin plates</i>,
which show the rays of light to be affected by an
alternation of two different conditions at small intervals
along their length, led Newton himself to incline, often and
strongly, to some hypothesis of undulation. The <i>double
refraction</i> of Iceland spar, a phenomenon in itself very
complex, could, it was found by Huyghens, be expressed with
great simplicity by a certain hypothesis of undulations.</p>
<p>Two hypotheses of the nature of the luminiferous medium were
thus brought under consideration; the one representing Light
as Matter emitted from the luminous object, the other, as
Undulations propagated through a fluid. These two hypotheses
remained in presence of each other during the whole of the
last century, neither of them gaining any material advantage
over the other, though the greater part of mathematicians,
following Newton, embraced the emission theory. But at the
beginning of the present century, an additional class of
phenomena, those of the <i>interference</i> of two rays of
light, were brought under <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page329">329</a></span> consideration by Dr. Young;
and these phenomena were strongly in favour of the
undulatory theory, while they were irreconcilable with the
hypothesis of emission. If it had not been for the original
bias of Newton and his school to the other side, there can
be little doubt that from this period light as well as sound
would have been supposed to be propagated by undulations;
although in this case it was necessary to assume as the
vehicle of such undulations a special medium or
<i>ether</i>. Several points of the phenomena of vision no
doubt remained unexplained by the undulatory theory, as
absorption, and the natural colours of bodies; but such
facts, though they did not confirm, did not evidently
contradict the theory of a Luminiferous Ether; and the facts
which such a theory did explain, it explained with singular
happiness and accuracy.</p>
<p>But before this Undulatory Theory could be generally
accepted, it was presented in an entirely new point of view
by being combined with the facts of <i>polarization</i>. The
general idea of polarization must be illustrated <a href="#v1page357">hereafter</a>;
but we may here remark that Young and Fresnel, who had
adopted the undulatory theory, after being embarrassed for
some time by the new facts which were thus presented to
their notice, at last saw that these facts might be
explained by conceiving the vibrations to be transverse to
the ray, the motions of the particles being not backwards
and forwards in the line in which the impulse travels, but
to the right and left of that line. This conception of
<i>transverse vibrations</i>, though quite unforeseen, had
nothing in it which was at all difficult to reconcile with
the general notion of an undulation. We have described an
undulation, or wave, as a certain condition or arrangement
of the particles of the fluid successively transferred from
one part of space to another: and it is easily conceivable
that this arrangement or wave may be produced by a lateral
transfer of the particles from their quiescent positions.
This conception of transverse vibrations being accepted, it
was found that the explanation of the phenomena of
polarization and of those of interference led to the same
theory <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page330">330</a></span> with a correspondence truly wonderful; and this
coincidence in the views, collected from two quite distinct
classes of phenomena, was justly considered as an almost
demonstrative evidence of the truth of this undulatory
theory.</p>
<p>It remained to be considered whether the doctrine of
transverse vibrations in a fluid could be reconciled with
the principles of Mechanics. And it was found that by making
certain suppositions, in which no inherent improbability
existed, the hypothesis of transverse vibrations would
explain the laws, both of interference and of polarization
of light, in air and in crystals of all kinds, with a
surprizing fertility and fidelity.</p>
<p>Thus the Undulatory Theory of Light, like the Undulatory
Theory of Sound, is recommended by its conformity to the
fundamental principle of the Secondary Mechanical Sciences,
that the medium must be supposed to transmit its peculiar
impulses according to the laws of Mechanics. Although no one
had previously dreamt of qualities being conveyed through a
medium by such a process, yet when it is once suggested as
the only mode of explaining some of the phenomena, there is
nothing to prevent our accepting it entirely, as a
satisfactory theory for all the known laws of Light.</p>
<p id="b4c3s4">4. <i>Heat.</i>&#8212;With regard to Heat as with regard to
Light, a fluid medium was necessarily assumed as the vehicle
of the property. During the last century, this medium was
supposed to be an emitted fluid. And many of the ascertained
Laws of Heat, those which prevail with regard to its
radiation more especially, were well explained by this
hypothesis<a id="fnanchor22-4" href="#note22-4"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>. Other effects of heat, however, as for
instance <i>latent heat</i><a id="fnanchor23-4" href="#note23-4"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>, and the change of
<i>consistence</i> of bodies<a id="fnanchor24-4" href="#note24-4"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>, were not satisfactorily
brought into connexion with the hypothesis; while <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page331">331</a></span>
<i>conduction</i><a id="fnanchor25-4" href="#note25-4"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>, which at first did not appear to
result from the fundamental assumption, was to a certain
extent explained as internal radiation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-4" href="#fnanchor22-4">22</a></span> See the Account of the Theory of Exchanges,
<i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. x. c. i. sect. 2.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-4" href="#fnanchor23-4">23</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> c. ii. sect. 3.</div>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-4" href="#fnanchor25-4">25</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> c. i. sect. 7.</div>
<p>But it was by no means clear that an Undulatory Theory of
Heat might not be made to explain these phenomena equally
well. Several philosophers inclined to such a theory; and
finally, Ampère showed that the doctrine that the heat of a
body consists in the undulations of its particles propagated
by means of the undulations of a medium, might be so
adjusted as to explain all which the theory of emission
could explain, and moreover to account for facts and laws
which were out of the reach of that theory. About the same
time it was discovered by Prof. Forbes and M. Nobili that
radiant heat is, under certain circumstances, polarized. Now
polarization had been most satisfactorily explained by means
of transverse undulations in the case of light; while all
attempts to modify the emission theory so as to include
polarization in it, had been found ineffectual. Hence this
discovery was justly considered as lending great countenance
to the opinion that Heat consists in the vibrations of its
proper medium.</p>
<p>But what is this medium? Is it the same by which the
impressions of Light are conveyed? This is a difficult
question; or rather it is one which we cannot at present
hope to answer with certainty. No doubt the connexion
between Light and Heat is so intimate and constant, that we
can hardly refrain from considering them as affections of
the same medium. But instead of attempting to erect our
systems on such loose and general views of connexion, it is
rather the business of the philosophers of the present day
to determine the laws of the operation of heat, and its real
relation to light, in order that we may afterwards be able
to connect the theories of the two qualities. Perhaps in a
more advanced state of our knowledge we may be able to state
it as an Axiom, that two Secondary Qualities, which are
intimately connected in their causes and effects, must be
affections of the same Medium. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page332">332</a></span> But at present it does
not appear safe to proceed upon such a principle, although
many writers, in their speculations both concerning Light
and Heat, and concerning other properties, have not
hesitated to do so.</p>
<p>Some other consequences follow from the Idea of a Medium
which must be the subject of another chapter.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page333"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Measure of Secondary Qualities.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> I.&#8212;<i>Scales of Qualities in general.</i></h4>
<p class="drop" id="b4c4s1"><span class="sc">THE</span> ultimate object of our investigation in each of the
Secondary Mechanical Sciences, is the nature of the
processes by which the special impressions of sound, light,
and heat, are conveyed, and the modifications of which these
processes are susceptible. And of this investigation, as we
have seen, the necessary basis is the principle, that these
impressions are transmitted by means of a medium. But before
we arrive at this ultimate object, we may find it necessary
to occupy ourselves with several intermediate objects:
before we discover the <em>cause</em>, it may be necessary
to determine the <em>laws</em> of the phenomena. Even if we
cannot immediately ascertain the mechanism of light or heat,
it may still be interesting and important to arrange and
measure the effects which we observe.</p>
<p>The idea of a Medium affects our proceeding in this research
also. We cannot measure Secondary qualities in the same
manner in which we measure Primary qualities, by a mere
addition of parts. There is this leading and remarkable
difference, that while both classes of qualities are
susceptible of changes of magnitude, primary qualities
increase by addition of <em>extension</em>, secondary, by
augmentation of <em>intensity</em>. A space is doubled when
another equal space is placed by its side; one weight joined
to another makes up the sum of the two. But when one degree
of warmth is combined with another, or one shade of red
colour with another, we cannot in like manner talk of the
<em>sum</em>. The component parts do not evidently retain
their <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page334">334</a></span> separate existence; we cannot separate a strong
green colour into two weaker ones, as we can separate a
large force into two smaller. The increase is absorbed into
the previous amount, and is no longer in evidence as a part
of the whole. And this is the difference which has given
birth to the two words <i>extended</i>, and <i>intense</i>.
That is extended which has ‘partes extra partes,’
parts outside of parts: that is intense which becomes
stronger by some indirect and unapparent increase of agency,
like the stretching of the internal springs of a machine, as
the term <i>intense</i> implies. Extended magnitudes can at
will be resolved into the parts of which they were
originally composed, or any other which the nature of their
extension admits; their proportion is apparent; they are
directly and at once subject to the relations of number.
Intensive magnitudes cannot be resolved into smaller
magnitudes; we can see that they differ, but we cannot tell
in what proportion; we have no direct measure of their
quantity. How many times hotter than blood is boiling water?
The answer cannot be given by the aid of our feelings of
heat alone.</p>
<p>The difference, as we have said, is connected with the
fundamental principle that we do not perceive Secondary
qualities directly, but through a Medium. We have no natural
apprehension of light, or sound, or heat, as they exist in
the bodies from which they proceed, but only as they affect
our organs. We can only measure them, therefore, by some
<i>Scale</i> supplied by their effects. And thus while
extended magnitudes, as space, time, are measurable directly
and of themselves; intensive magnitudes, as brightness,
loudness, heat, are measurable only by artificial means and
conventional scales. Space, time, measure themselves: the
repetition of a smaller space, or time, while it composes a
larger one, measures it. But for light and heat we must have
Photometers and Thermometers, which measure something which
is assumed to be an indication of the quality in question.
In the one case, the mode of applying the measure, and the
meaning of the number resulting, are seen by intuition; in
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page335">335</a></span> other, they are consequences of assumption and
reasoning. In the one case, they are <em>Units</em>, of
which the extension is made up; in the other, they are
<em>Degrees</em> by which the intensity ascends.</p>
<p id="b4c4s2">2. When we discover any property in a sensible quality,
which at once refers us to number or space, we readily take
this property as a measure; and thus we make a transition
from quality to quantity. Thus Ptolemy in the third chapter
of the First Book of his <i>Harmonics</i> begins thus: ‘As
to the differences which exist in sounds both in
<em>quality</em> and in <em>quantity</em>, if we consider
that difference which refers to the acuteness and graveness,
we cannot at once tell to which of the above two classes it
belongs, till we have considered the causes of such
symptoms.’ But at the end of the chapter, having satisfied
himself that grave sounds result from the magnitude of the
string or pipe, other things being equal, he infers, ‘Thus
the difference of acute and grave appears to be a difference
of <em>quantity</em>.’</p>
<p>In the same manner, in order to form Secondary Mechanical
Sciences respecting any of the other properties of bodies,
we must reduce these properties to a dependence upon
quantity, and thus make them subject to measurement. We
cannot obtain any sciential truths respecting the comparison
of sensible qualities, till we have discovered measures and
scales of the qualities which we have to consider; and
accordingly, some of the most important steps in such
sciences have been the establishment of such measures and
scales, and the invention of the requisite instruments.</p>
<p>The formation of the mathematical sciences which rest upon
the measures of the intensity of sensible qualities took
place mainly in the course of the last century. Perhaps we
may consider Lambert, a mathematician who resided in
Switzerland, and published about 1750, as the person who
first clearly felt the importance of establishing such
sciences. His Photometry, Pyrometry, and Hygrometry, are
examples of the systematic reduction of sensible qualities
(light, heat, moisture) to modes of numerical measurement. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page336">336</a></span></p>
<p>We now proceed to speak of such modes of measurement with
regard to the most obvious properties of bodies.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.&#8212;<i>The Musical Scale.</i></h4>
<p id="b4c4s3">3. <span class="sc">The</span> establishment of the <i>Harmonic Canon</i>, that is,
of a Scale and Measure of the musical place of notes, in the
relation of <em>high</em> and <em>low</em>, was the first
step in the science of Harmonics. The perception of the
differences and relations of musical sounds is the office of
the sense of hearing; but these relations are fixed, and
rendered accurately recognizable by artificial means.
‘Indeed, in all the senses,’ as Ptolemy truly says in the
opening of his Harmonics, ‘the sense discovers what is
approximately true, and receives accuracy from another
quarter: the reason receives the approximately-true from
another quarter, and discovers the accurate truth.’ We can
have no measures of sensible qualities which do not
ultimately refer to the sense;&#8212;whether they do this
immediately, as when we refer Colours to an assumed
Standard; or mediately, as when we measure Heat by
Expansion, having previously found by an appeal to sense
that the expansion increases with the heat. Such relations
of sensible qualities cannot be described in words, and can
only be apprehended by their appropriate faculty. The
faculty by which the relations of sounds are apprehended is
a <i>musical ear</i> in the largest acceptation of the term.
In this signification the faculty is nearly universal among
men; for all persons have musical ears sufficiently delicate
to understand and to imitate the modulations corresponding
to various emotions in speaking; which modulations depend
upon the succession of acuter and graver tones. These are
the relations now spoken of, and these are plainly perceived
by persons who have very imperfect musical ears, according
to the common use of the phrase. But the relations of tones
which occur in speaking are somewhat indefinite; and in
forming that musical scale which is the basis of our science
upon the subject, we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page337">337</a></span> take the most definite and marked
of such relations of notes; such as occur, not in speaking
but in singing. Those musical relations of two sounds which
we call the <i>octave</i>, the <i>fifth</i>, the
<i>fourth</i>, the <i>third</i>, are recognized after a
short familiarity with them. These <i>chords</i> or
<i>intervals</i> are perceived to have each a peculiar
character, which separates them from the relations of two
sounds taken at random, and makes it easy to know them when
sung or played on an instrument; and for most persons, not
difficult to sing the sounds in succession exactly, or
nearly correct. These musical relations, or <i>concords</i>,
then, are the groundwork of our musical series of sounds.
But how are we to name these indescribable sensible
characters? how to refer, with unerring accuracy, to a type
which exists only in our own perceptions? We must have for
this purpose a <i>Scale</i> and a <i>Standard</i>.</p>
<p>The Musical Scale is a series of eight notes, ascending by
certain steps from the first or key-note to the octave above
it, each of the notes being fixed by such distinguishable
musical relations as we have spoken of above. We may call
these notes <span class="sc">c, d, e, f, g, a, b</span>, <i>c</i>; and we may then
say that <span class="sc">g</span> is determined by its being a fifth above <span class="sc">c; d</span> by
its being a fourth below <span class="sc">g; e</span> by its being a third above <span class="sc">c</span>;
and similarly of the rest. It will be recollected that the
terms a <i>fifth</i>, a <i>fourth</i>, a <i>third</i>, have
hitherto been introduced as expressing certain simple and
indescribable musical relations among sounds, which might
have been indicated by any other names. Thus we might call
the fifth the <i>dominant</i>, and the fourth the
<i>subdominant</i>, as is done in one part of musical
science. But the names we have used, which are the common
ones, are in fact derived from the number of notes which
these intervals include in the scale obtained in the above
manner. The notes, <span class="sc">c, d, e, f, g</span>, being five, the interval
from <span class="sc">c</span> to <span class="sc">g</span> is a fifth, and so of the rest. The fixation of
this scale gave the means of describing exactly any note
which occurs in the scale, and the method is easily
applicable to notes above and below this range; for in a
series of sounds higher or lower by an octave than <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page338">338</a></span>
this standard series, the ear discovers a recurrence of the
same relations so exact, that a person may sometimes imagine
he is producing the same notes as another when he is singing
the same air an octave higher. Hence the next eight notes
may be conveniently denoted by a repetition of the same
letters, as the first; thus, <span class="sc">c, d, e, f, g, a, b,</span> <i>c</i>,
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>;
and it is easy to devise a continuation of such cycles. And
other admissible notes are designated by a further
modification of the standard ones, as by making each note
<i>flat</i> or <i>sharp</i>; which modification it is not
necessary here to consider, since our object is only to show
how a standard is attainable, and how it serves the ends of
science.</p>
<p>We may observe, however, that the above is not an exact
account of the first, or early Greek scale; for that scale
was founded on a primary division of the interval of two
octaves (the extreme range which it admitted) into five
<i>tetrachords</i>, each tetrachord including the interval
of a fourth. All the notes of this series had different
names borrowed from this division<a id="fnanchor26-4" href="#note26-4"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>; thus <i>mese</i>
was the middle or key-note; the note below it was
<i>lichanos mesôn</i>, the next below was <i>parypate
mesôn</i>, the next lower, <i>hypate mesôn</i>. The fifth
above <i>mese</i> was <i>nete diazeugmenôn</i>, the octave
was <i>nete hyperbolæôn</i>.</p>

<p id="b4c4s4">4. But supposing a complete system of such denominations
established, how could it be with certainty and rigour
applied? The human ear is fallible, the organs of voice
imperfectly obedient; if this were not so, there would be no
such thing as a <em>good</em> ear or a <em>good</em> voice.
What means can be devised of finding at will a
<em>perfect</em> concord, a fifth or a fourth? Or supposing
such concords fixed by an acknowledged authority, how can
they be referred to, and the authority adduced? How can we
enact a Standard of sounds?</p>
<p>A Standard was discovered in the <i>Monochord</i>. A musical
string properly stretched, may be made to produce different
notes, in proportion as we intercept a longer or shorter
portion, and make this portion <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page339">339</a></span> vibrate. The relation
of the length of the strings which thus sound the two notes
<span class="sc">g</span> and <span class="sc">c</span> is fixed and constant, and the same is true of all
other notes. Hence the musical interval of any notes of
which we know the places in the musical scale, may be
reproduced by measuring the lengths of string which are
known to give them. If <span class="sc">c</span> be of the length 180, <span class="sc">d</span> is 160, <span class="sc">e</span>
is 144, <span class="sc">f</span> is 135, <span class="sc">g</span> is 120; and thus the musical relations
are reduced to numerical relations, and the monochord is a
complete and perfect <i>Tonometer</i>.</p>
<p>We have here taken the length of the string as the measure
of the tone: but we may observe that there is in us a
necessary tendency to assume that the ground of this measure
is to be sought in some ulterior cause; and when we consider
the matter further, we find this cause in the frequency of
these vibrations of the string. The truth that the same note
must result from the same frequency of vibration is readily
assented to on a slight suggestion of experience. Thus
Mersenne<a id="fnanchor27-4" href="#note27-4"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>, when he undertakes to determine the
frequency of vibrations of a given sound, says
‘Supponendum est quoscunque nervos et quaslibet chordas
unisonum facientes eundem efficere numerum recursuum eodem
vel equali tempore, quod perpetuâ constat experientiâ.’
And he proceeds to apply it to cases where experience could
not verify this assertion, or at least had not verified it,
as to that of pipes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-4" href="#fnanchor27-4">27</a></span> <i>Harmonia</i>, lib. ii. prop. 19.</div>
<p>The pursuit of these numerical relations of tones forms the
science of Harmonics; of which here we do not pretend to
give an account, but only to show, how the invention of a
Scale and Nomenclature, a Standard and Measure of the tone
of sounds, is its necessary basis. We will therefore now
proceed to speak of another subject; <i>colour</i>.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> III.&#8212;<i>Scales of Colour.</i></h4>
<p id="b4c4s5">5. <i>The Prismatic Scale of Colour.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">A Scale</span> of Colour
must depend originally upon differences <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page340">340</a></span> discernible by
the eye, as a scale of notes depends on differences
perceived by the ear. In one respect the difficulty is
greater in the case of the visible qualities, for there are
no relations of colour which the eye peculiarly singles out
and distinguishes, as the ear selects and distinguishes an
octave or a fifth. Hence we are compelled to take an
arbitrary scale; and we have to find one which is fixed, and
which includes a proper collection of colours. The
<i>prismatic spectrum</i>, or coloured image produced when a
small beam of light passes obliquely through any transparent
surface (as the surface of a prism of glass,) offers an
obvious Standard as far as it is applicable. Accordingly
colours have, for various purposes, been designated by their
place in the spectrum, ever since the time of Newton; and we
have thus a means of referring to such colours as are
included in the series <i>red</i>, <i>orange</i>,
<i>yellow</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>blue</i>, <i>violet</i>,
<i>indigo</i>, and the intermediate tints.</p>
<p>But this scale is not capable of numerical precision. If the
spectrum could be exactly defined as to its extremities, and
if these colours occupied always the same proportional part
of it, we might describe any colour in the above series by
the measure of its position. But the fact is otherwise. The
spectrum is too indefinite in its boundaries to afford any
distinct point from which we may commence our measures; and
moreover the spectra produced by different transparent
bodies differ from each other. Newton had supposed that the
spectrum and its parts were the same, so long as the
refraction was the same; but his successors discovered that,
with the same amount of refraction in different kinds of
glass, there are different magnitudes of the spectrum; and
what is still worse with reference to our present purpose,
that the spectra from different glasses have the colours
distributed in different proportions. In order, therefore,
to make the spectrum the scale of colour, we must assume
some fixed substance; for instance, we may take water, and
thus a series approaching to the colours of the
<i>rainbow</i> will be our standard. But we should still
have an extreme difficulty in applying such a rule. The
distinctions of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page341">341</a></span> colour which the terms of common
language express, are not used with perfect unanimity or
with rigorous precision. What one person calls <i>bluish
green</i> another calls <i>greenish blue</i>. Nobody can say
what is the precise boundary between red and orange. Thus
the prismatic scale of colour was incapable of mathematical
exactness, and this inconvenience was felt up to our own
times.</p>
<p>But this difficulty was removed by a curious discovery of
Wollaston and Fraunhofer; who found that there are, in the
solar spectrum, certain fine black Lines which occupy a
definite place in the series of colours, and can be observed
with perfect precision. We have now no uncertainty as to
what coloured light we are speaking of, when we describe it
as that part of the spectrum in which Fraunhofer’s Line <span class="sc">c</span> or
<span class="sc">d</span> occurs. And thus, by this discovery, the prismatic
spectrum of sunlight became, for certain purposes, an exact
<i>Chromatometer</i>.</p>
<p id="b4c4s6">6. <i>Newton’s Scale of Colours.</i>&#8212;Still, such a
standard, though definite, is arbitrary and seemingly
anomalous. The lines <span class="sc">a, b, c, d</span>, &amp;c., of Fraunhofer’s
spectrum are distributed without any apparent order or law;
and we do not, in this way, obtain numerical measures, which
is what, in all cases, we desire to have. Another discovery
of Newton, however, gives us a spectrum containing the same
colours as the prismatic spectrum, but produced in another
way, so that the colours have a numerical relation. I speak
of the laws of the <i>Colours of Thin Plates</i>. The little
rainbows which we sometimes see in the cracks of broken
glass are governed by fixed and simple laws. The kind of
colour produced at any point depends on the thickness of the
thin plate of air included in the fissure. If the thickness
be eight-millionths of an inch, the colour is orange, if
fifteen-millionths of an inch, we have green, and so on; and
thus these numbers, which succeed each other in a regular
order from red to indigo, give a numerical measure of each
colour; which measure, when we pursue the subject, we find
is one of the bases of all optical theory. The series of
colours obtained from plates of air of gradually increasing
thickness is called <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page342">342</a></span> <i>Newton’s Scale of Colours</i>;
but we may observe that this is not precisely what we are
here speaking of, a scale of <i>simple</i> colours; it is a
series produced by certain combinations, resulting from the
repetition of the first spectrum, and is mainly useful as a
standard for similar phenomena, and not for colour in
general. The real scale of colour is to be found, as we have
said, in the numbers which express the thickness of the
producing film;&#8212;in the length of a <i>fit</i> in Newton’s
phraseology, or the length of an <i>undulation</i> in the
modern theory.</p>
<p id="b4c4s7">7. <i>Scales of Impure Colours.</i>&#8212;The standards just
spoken of include (mainly at least) only pure and simple
colours; and however complete these standards may be for
certain objects of the science of optics, they are
insufficient for other purposes. They do not enable us to
put in their place mixed and impure colours. And there is,
in the case of colour, a difficulty already noticed, which
does not occur in the case of sound; two notes, when sounded
together, are not necessarily heard as one; they are
recognized as still two, and as forming a concord or a
discord. But two colours form a single colour; and the eye
cannot, in any way, distinguish between a green compound of
blue and yellow, and the simple, undecomposable green of the
spectrum. By composition of three or more colours,
innumerable new colours may be generated which form no part
of the prismatic series; and by such compositions is woven
the infinitely varied web of colour which forms the clothing
of nature. How are we to classify and arrange all the
possible colours of objects, so that each shall have a place
and name? How shall we find a <i>chromatometer</i> for
impure as well as for pure colour?</p>
<p>Though no optical investigations have depended on a scale of
impure colours, such a scale has been wanted and invented
for other purposes; for instance, in order to identify and
describe objects of natural history. Not to speak of earlier
essays, we may notice Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours,
devised for the purpose of describing minerals. This scale
of colour was far superior to any which had previously been
promulgated. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page343">343</a></span> It was, indeed, arbitrary in the
selection of its degrees, and in a great measure in their
arrangement; and the colours were described by the usual
terms, though generally with some added distinction; as
<i>blackish green</i>, <i>bluish green</i>,
<i>apple-green</i>, <i>emerald-green</i>. But the great
merit of the scale was its giving a <em>fixed</em>
conventional meaning to these terms, so that they lost much
of their usual vagueness. Thus <i>apple-green</i> did not
mean the colour of any green apple casually taken; but a
certain definite colour which the student was to bear in
mind, whether or not he had ever seen an apple of that exact
hue. The words were not a description, but a <em>record</em>
of the colour: the memory was to retain a
<em>sensation</em>, not a name.</p>
<p>The imperfection of the system (arising from its arbitrary
form) was its incompleteness: however well it served for the
reference of the colours which it did contain, it was
applicable to no others; and thus though Werner’s
enumeration extended to more than a hundred colours, there
occur in nature a still greater number which cannot be
exactly described by means of it.</p>
<p>In such cases the unclassed colour is, by the Wernerians,
defined by stating it as intermediate between two others:
thus we have an object described as <i>between emerald-green
and grass-green</i>. The eye is capable of perceiving a
gradation from one colour to another; such as may be
produced by a gradual mixture in various ways. And if we
image to ourselves such a mixture, we can compare with it a
given colour. But in employing this method we have nothing
to tell us in what part of the scale we must seek for an
approximation to our unclassed colour. We have no rule for
discovering where we are to look for the boundaries of the
definition of a colour which the Wernerian series does not
supply. For it is not always between contiguous members of
the series that the undescribed colour is found. If we place
emerald-green between apple-green and grass-green, we may
yet have a colour intermediate between emerald-green and
leek-green; and, in fact, the Wernerian series of colours is
destitute <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page344">344</a></span> of a principle of self-arrangement and
gradation; and is thus necessarily and incurably imperfect.</p>
<p id="b4c4s8">8. We should have a complete Scale of Colours, if we could
form a series including all colours, and arranged so that
each colour was intermediate in its tint between the
adjacent terms of the series; for then, whether we took many
or few of the steps of the series for our standard terms,
the rest could be supplied by the law of continuity; and any
given colour would either correspond to one of the steps of
our scale or fall between two intermediate ones. The
invention of a Chromatometer for Impure Colours, therefore,
requires that we should be able to form all possible colours
by such intermediation in a systematic manner; that is, by
the mixture or combination of certain elementary colours
according to a simple rule: and we are led to ask whether
such a process has been shown to be possible.</p>
<p>The colours of the prismatic spectrum obviously do form a
continuous series; green is intermediate between its
neighbours yellow and blue, orange between red and yellow;
and if we suppose the two ends of the spectrum bent round to
meet each other, so that the arrangement of the colours may
be circular, the violet and indigo will find their
appropriate place between the blue and red. And all the
interjacent tints of the spectrum, as well as the ones just
named, will result from such an arrangement. Thus all the
<em>pure</em> colours are produced by combinations two and
two of three primary colours, Red, Yellow, and Blue: and the
question suggests itself whether these three are not really
the only Primary Colours, and whether all the impure colours
do not arise from mixtures of the three in various
proportions. There are various modes in which this
suggestion may be applied to the construction of a scale of
colours; but the simplest, and the one which appears really
to verify the conjecture that all possible colours may be so
exhibited, is the following. A certain combination of red,
yellow, and blue, will produce black, or pure grey, and when
diluted, will give all the shades of grey which intervene
between <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page345">345</a></span> black and white. By adding various shades of
grey, then, to pure colours, we may obtain all the possible
ternary combinations of red, yellow, and blue; and in this
way it is found that we exhaust the range of colours. Thus
the circle of pure colours of which we have spoken may be
accompanied by several other circles, in which these colours
are tinged with a less or greater shade of grey; and in this
manner it is found that we have a perfect chromatometer;
every possible colour being exhibited either exactly or by
means of approximate and contiguous limits. The arrangement
of colours has been brought into this final and complete
form by M. Merimée, whose Chromatic Scale is published by M.
Mirbel in his <i>Elements of Botany</i>. We may observe that
such a standard affords us a numerical exponent for every
colour by means of the proportions of the three primary
colours which compose it; or, expressing the same result
otherwise, by means of the pure colour which is involved,
and the proportion of grey by which it is rendered impure.
In such a scale the fundamental elements would be the
precise tints of red, yellow, and blue which are found or
assumed to be primary; the numerical exponents of each
colour would depend upon the arbitrary number of degrees
which we interpose between each two primary colours; and
between each pure colour and absolute blackness. No such
numerical scale has, however, as yet, obtained general
acceptation<a id="fnanchor28-4" href="#note28-4"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-4" href="#fnanchor28-4">28</a></span> The reference to <i>Fraunhofer’s Lines</i>, as a
means of determining the place of a colour in the prismatic
series, has been objected to, because, as is asserted, the
colours which are in the neighbourhood of each line vary
with the position of the sun, state of the atmosphere and
the like. It is very evident that coloured light refracted
by the prism will not give the same spectrum as white light.
The spectrum given by white light is of course the one here
meant. It is an usual practice of optical experimenters to
refer to the colours of such a spectrum, defining them by
Fraunhofer’s Lines.<br/>
&#8195;I do not know whether it needs explanation that the ‘first
spectrum’ in Newton’s rings is a ring of the prismatic
colours.<br/>
&#8195;I have not had an opportunity of consulting Lambert’s
<i>Photometria, sive de mensura et gradibus luminis,
colorum, et umbræ</i>, published in 1760, nor Mayer’s
<i>Commentatio de Affinitate Colorum</i>, (1758), in
which, I believe, he describes a chromatometer. The present
work is not intended to be complete as a history; and I hope
I have given sufficient historical detail  to answer its
philosophical purpose.</div>

<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> IV.&#8212;<i>Scales of Light.</i></h4>
<p id="b4c4s9">9. <i>Photometer.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">Another</span> instrument much needed in
optical researches is a <i>Photometer</i>, a measure of the
intensity of light. In this case, also, the organ of sense,
the eye, is the ultimate judge; nor has any effect of light,
as light, yet been discovered which we can substitute for
such a judgment. All instruments, such as that of Leslie,
which employ the heating effect of light, or at least all
that have hitherto been proposed, are inadmissible as
photometers. But though the eye can judge of two surfaces
illuminated by light of the same colour, and can determine
when they are equally bright, or which is the brighter, the
eye can by no means decide at sight the proportion of
illumination. How much in such judgments we are affected by
contrast, is easily seen when we consider how different is
the apparent brightness of the moon at mid-day and at
midnight, though the light which we receive from her is, in
fact, the same at both periods. In order to apply a scale in
this case, we must take advantage of the known numerical
relations of light. We are certain that if all other
illumination be excluded, two equal luminaries, under the
same circumstances, will produce an illumination twice as
great as one does; and we can easily prove, from
mathematical considerations, that if light be not enfeebled
by the medium through which it passes, the illumination on a
given surface will diminish as the square of the distance of
the luminary increases. If, therefore, we can by taking a
fraction thus known of the illuminating effect of one
luminary, make it equal to the total effect of another, of
which equality the eye is a competent judge, we compare the
effects of the two luminaries. In order to make this
comparison we may, with Rumford, look at the shadows of the
same object made by the two lights, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page347">347</a></span> or with Ritchie,
we may view the brightness produced on two contiguous
surfaces, framing an apparatus so that the equality may be
brought about by proper adjustment; and thus a measure will
become practicable. Or we may employ other methods as was
done by Wollaston<a id="fnanchor29-4" href="#note29-4"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a>, who reduced the light of the sun by
observing it as reflected from a bright globule, and thus
found the light of the sun to be 10,000,000,000 times that
of Sirius, the brightest fixed star. All these methods are
inaccurate, even as methods of comparison; and do not offer
any fixed or convenient numerical standard; but none better
have yet been devised<a id="fnanchor30-4" href="#note30-4"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-4" href="#fnanchor29-4">29</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1820, p. 19.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-4" href="#fnanchor30-4">30</a></span> Improved Photometers have been devised by
Professor Wheatstone, Professor Potter, and Professor

<p id="b4c4s10">10. <i>Cyanometer.</i>&#8212;As we thus measure the brightness of
a colourless light, we may measure the intensity of any
particular colour in the same way; that is, by applying a
standard exhibiting the gradations of the colour in question
till we find a shade which is seen to agree with the
proposed object. Such an instrument we have in the
<i>Cyanometer</i>, which was invented by Saussure for the
purpose of measuring the intensity of the blue colour of the
sky. We may introduce into such an instrument a numerical
scale, but the numbers in such a scale will be altogether
arbitrary.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> V.&#8212;<i>Scales of Heat.</i></h4>
<p id="b4c4s11">11. <i>Thermometers.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">When</span> we proceed to the sensation
of heat, and seek a measure of that quality, we find, at
first sight, new difficulties. Our sensations of this kind
are more fluctuating than those of vision; for we know that
the same object may feel warm to one hand and cold to
another at the same instant, if the hands have been
previously cooled and warmed respectively. Nor can we obtain
here, as in the case of light, self-evident numerical
relations of the heat communicated in given circumstances;
for we know that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page348">348</a></span> effect so produced will depend on
the warmth of the body to be heated, as well as on that of
the source of heat; the summer sun, which warms our bodies,
will not augment the heat of a red-hot iron. The cause of
the difference of these cases is, that bodies do not receive
the whole of their heat, as they receive the whole of their
light, from the immediate influence of obvious external
agents. There is no readily-discovered absolute cold,
corresponding to the absolute darkness which we can easily
produce or imagine. Hence we should be greatly at a loss to
devise a <i>Thermometer</i>, if we did not find an indirect
effect of heat sufficiently constant and measurable to
answer this purpose. We discover, however, such an effect in
the <i>expansion</i> of bodies by the effect of heat.</p>
<p id="b4c4s12">12. Many obvious phenomena show that air, under given
circumstances, expands by the effect of heat; the same is
seen to be true of liquids, as of water, and spirit of wine;
and the property is found to belong also to the metallic
fluid, quicksilver. A more careful examination showed that
the increase of bulk in some of these bodies by increase of
Heat was a fact of a nature sufficiently constant and
regular to afford a means of measuring that previously
intangible quality; and the Thermometer was invented. There
were, however, many difficulties to overcome, and many
points to settle, before this instrument was fit for the
purposes of science.</p>
<p>An explanation of the way in which this was done necessarily
includes an important chapter of the history of Thermotics.
We must now, therefore, briefly notice historically the
progress of the Thermometer. The leading steps of this
progress, after the first invention of the instrument,
were&#8212;The establishment of <i>fixed points</i> in the
thermometric scale&#8212;The <i>comparison of the scales</i> of
different substances&#8212;And the reconcilement of these
differences by some method of interpreting them as
indications of the absolute <i>quantity of heat</i>.</p>
<p id="b4c4s13">13. It would occupy too much space to give in detail the
history of the successive attempts by which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page349">349</a></span> these
steps were effected. A thermometer is described by Bacon
under the title <i>Vitrum Calendare</i>; this was an
air thermometer. Newton used a thermometer of linseed oil,
and he perceived that the first step requisite to give value
to such an instrument was to fix its scale; accordingly he
proposed his <i>Scala Graduum Caloris</i><a id="fnanchor31-4" href="#note31-4"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a>. But
when thermometers of different liquids were compared, it
appeared, from their discrepancies, that this fixation of
the scale of heat was more difficult than had been supposed.
It was, however, effected. Newton had taken freezing water,
or rather thawing snow, as the zero of his scale, which is
really a fixed point; Halley and Amontons discovered (in
1693 and 1702) that the heat of boiling water is another
fixed point; and Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, of Dantzig, by
carefully applying these two standard points, produced,
about 1714, thermometers, which were constantly consistent
with each other. This result was much admired at the time,
and was, in fact, the solution of the problem just stated,
the <em>fixation of the scale of heat</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note31-4" href="#fnanchor31-4">31</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1701.</div>
<p id="b4c4s14">14. But the scale thus obtained is a conventional not a
natural scale. It depends upon the fluid employed for the
thermometer. The progress of expansion from the heat of
freezing to that of boiling water is different for mercury,
oil, water, spirit of wine, air. A degree of heat which is
half-way between these two standard points according to a
mercurial thermometer, will be below the half-way point in a
spirit thermometer, and above it in an air thermometer. Each
liquid has its own <i>march</i> in the course of its
expansion. Deluc and others compared the marches of various
liquids, and thus made what we may call a <i>concordance</i>
of thermometers of various kinds.</p>
<p id="b4c4s15">15. Here the question further occurs: Is there not some
<em>natural measure</em> of the degrees of heat? It appears
certain that there must be such a measure, and that by means
of it all the scales of different liquids must be
reconciled. Yet this does not seem to have occurred at once
to men’s minds. Deluc, in speaking <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page350">350</a></span> of the researches
which we have just mentioned, says<a id="fnanchor32-4" href="#note32-4"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a>, ‘When I undertook
these experiments, it never once came into my thoughts that
they could conduct me with any probability to a table of
real degrees of heat. But hope grows with success, and
desire with hope.’ Accordingly he pursued this inquiry for a
long course of years.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note32-4" href="#fnanchor32-4">32</a></span> <i>Modif. de l’Atmosph.</i> 1782, p. 303.</div>
<p>What are the principles by which we are to be guided to the
true measure of heat? Here, as in all the sciences of this
class, we have the general principle, that the secondary
quality, Heat, must be supposed to be perceived in some way
by a material Medium or Fluid. If we take that which is,
perhaps, the simplest form of this hypothesis, that the heat
depends upon the <em>quantity</em> of this fluid, or
<i>Caloric</i>, which is present, we shall find that we are
led to propositions which may serve as a foundation for a
natural measure of heat. The <i>Method of Mixtures</i> is
one example of such a result. If we mix together two pints
of water, one hot and one cold, is it not manifest that the
temperature of the mixture must be midway between the two?
Each of the two portions brings with it its own heat. The
whole heat, or caloric, of the mixture is the sum of the
two; and the heat of each half must be the half of this sum,
and therefore its temperature must be intermediate between
the temperatures of the equal portions which were mixed.
Deluc made experiments founded upon this principle, and was
led by them to conclude that ‘the dilatations of mercury
follow an accelerated march for successive equal
augmentations of heat.’</p>
<p>But there are various circumstances which prevent this
method of mixtures from being so satisfactory as at first
sight it seems to promise to be. The different capacities
for heat of different substances, and even of the same
substance at different temperatures, introduce much
difficulty into the experiments; and this path of inquiry
has not yet led to a satisfactory result. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page351">351</a></span></p>
<p id="b4c4s16">16. Another mode of inquiring into the natural measure of
heat is to seek it by researches on the <i>law of
cooling</i> of hot bodies. If we assume that the process of
cooling of hot bodies consists in a certain material heat
flying off, we may, by means of certain probable hypotheses,
determine mathematically the law according to which the
temperature decreases as time goes on; and we may assume
<em>that</em> to be the true measure of temperature which
gives to the experimental law of cooling the most simple and
probable form.</p>
<p>It appears evident from the most obvious conceptions which
we can form of the manner in which a body parts with its
superabundant heat, that the hotter a body is, the faster it
cools; though it is not clear without experiment, by what
law the rate of cooling will depend upon the heat of the
body. Newton took for granted the most simple and seemingly
natural law of this dependence: he supposed the rate of
cooling to be <em>proportional</em> to the temperature, and
from this supposition he could deduce the temperature of a
hot iron, calculating from the original temperature and the
time during which it had been cooling. By calculation
founded on such a basis, he graduated his thermometer.</p>
<p id="b4c4s17">17. But a little further consideration showed that the rate
of cooling of a hot body depended upon the temperature of
the surrounding bodies, as well as upon its own temperature.
Prevost’s <i>Theory of Exchanges</i><a id="fnanchor33-4" href="#note33-4"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a> was propounded
with a view of explaining this dependence, and was generally
accepted. According to this theory, all bodies radiate heat
to one another, and are thus constantly giving and receiving
heat; and a body which is hotter than surrounding bodies,
cools itself, and warms the surrounding, bodies, by an
exchange of heat for heat, in which they are the gainers.
Hence if <i>θ</i> be the temperature of the bodies, or of the
space, by which the hot body is surrounded, and <i>θ</i> + <i>t</i>
the temperature of the hot body, the rate of cooling will
depend <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page352">352</a></span> upon the excess of the radiation for a
temperature <i>θ</i> + <i>t</i>, above the radiation for a
temperature <i>θ</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-4" href="#fnanchor33-4">33</a></span> <i>Recherches sur la Chaleur</i>, 1791. <i>Hist.
Ind. Sc.</i> b. x. c. i. sect. 2.</div>
<p>Accordingly, in the admirable researches of MM. Dulong and
Petit upon the cooling of bodies, it was assumed that the
rate of cooling of the hot body was represented by the
excess of F(<i>θ</i> + <i>t</i>) above F(<i>θ</i>); where F represented
some mathematical <i>function</i>, that is, some expression
obtained by arithmetical operations from the temperatures θ
+ <i>t</i> and <i>θ</i>; although what these operations are to
be, was left undecided, and was in fact determined by the
experiments. And the result of their investigations was,
that the function is of this kind: when the temperature
increases by equal intervals, the function increases in a
continued geometric proportion<a id="fnanchor34-4" href="#note34-4"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a>. This was, in fact, the
same law which had been assumed by Newton and others, with
this difference, that <em>they</em> had neglected the term
which depends upon the temperature of the surrounding space.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-4" href="#fnanchor34-4">34</a></span> The formula for the rate of cooling is <i>ma<sup>θ
+ t</sup> &#8722; ma<sup>θ</sup></i>, where the quantity <i>m</i> depends upon
the nature of the body, the state of its surface, and  other
circumstances.&#8212;<i>Ann. Chim.</i> vii. 150.</div>
<p id="b4c4s18">18. This law falls in so well with the best conceptions we
can form of the mechanism of cooling upon the supposition of
a radiant fluid caloric, that it gives great probability to
the scale of temperature on which the simplicity of the
result depends. Now the temperatures in the formulæ just
referred to were expressed by means of the <i>air
thermometer</i>. Hence MM. Dulong and Petit justly state,
that while all different substances employed as thermometers
give different laws of thermotical phenomena, their own
success in obtaining simple and general laws by means of the
air thermometer, is a strong recommendation of that as the
<i>natural scale of heat</i>. They add<a id="fnanchor35-4" href="#note35-4"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a>, ‘The
well-known uniformity of the principal physical properties
of all gases, and especially the perfect identity of their
laws of dilatation by heat, [a very important discovery of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page353">353</a></span> Dalton and Gay Lussac<a id="fnanchor36-4" href="#note36-4"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a>,] make it very probable
that in this class of bodies the disturbing causes have not
the same influence as in solids and liquids; and
consequently that the changes of bulk produced by the action
of heat are here in a more immediate dependence on the force
which produces them.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-4" href="#fnanchor35-4">35</a></span> <i>Annales de Chimie</i>, vii. 153.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-4" href="#fnanchor36-4">36</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. x. c. ii. sect. 1.</div>
<p id="b4c4s19">19. Still we cannot consider this point as settled till we
obtain a more complete theoretical insight into the nature
of heat itself. If it be true that heat consists in the
vibrations of a fluid, then, although, as Ampère has
shown<a id="fnanchor37-4" href="#note37-4"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a>, the laws of radiation will, on mathematical
grounds, be the same as they are on the hypothesis of
emission, we cannot consider the natural scale of heat as
determined, till we have discovered some means of measuring
the caloriferous vibrations as we measure luminiferous
vibrations. We shall only know what the quantity of heat is
when we know what heat itself is;&#8212;when we have obtained a
theory which satisfactorily explains the manner in which the
substance or medium of heat produces its effects. When we
see how radiation and conduction, dilatation and
liquefaction, are all produced by mechanical changes of the
same fluid, we shall then see what the nature of that change
is which dilatation really measures, and what relation it
bears to any more proper standard of heat.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-4" href="#fnanchor37-4">37</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> c. iv.</div>
<p>We may add, that while our thermotical theory is still so
imperfect as it is, all attempts to divine the true nature
of the relation between light and heat are premature, and
must be in the highest degree insecure and visionary.
Speculations in which, from the general assumption of a
caloriferous and luminiferous medium, and from a few facts
arbitrarily selected and loosely analysed, a general theory
of light and heat is asserted, are entirely foreign to the
course of inductive science, and cannot lead to any stable
and substantial truth.</p>
<p id="b4c4s20">20. <i>Other Instruments for measuring Heat.</i>&#8212;It does
not belong to our present purpose to speak of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page354">354</a></span>
instruments of which the object is to measure, not sensible
qualities, but some effect or modification of the cause by
which such qualities are produced: such, for instance, are
the <i>Calorimeter</i>, employed by Lavoisier and Laplace,
in order to compare the <i>Specific Heat</i> of different
substances; and the <i>Actinometer</i>, invented by Sir John
Herschel, in order to determine the <i>effect of the Sun’s
Rays</i> by means of the heat which they communicate in a
given time; which effect is, as may readily be supposed,
very different under different circumstances of atmosphere
and position. The laws of such effects may be valuable
contributions to our knowledge of heat, but the
interpretation of them must depend on a previous knowledge
of the relations which temperature bears to heat, according
to the views just explained.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> VI.&#8212;<i>Scales of other Qualities.</i></h4>
<p id="b4c4s21">21. <span class="sc">Before</span> quitting the subject of the measures of sensible
qualities, we may observe that there are several other such
qualities for which it would be necessary to have scales and
means of measuring, in order to make any approach to science
on such subjects. This is true, for instance, of Tastes and
Smells. Indeed some attempts have been made towards a
classification of the Tastes of sapid substances, but these
have not yet assumed any satisfactory or systematic
character; and I am not aware that any instrument has been
suggested for <em>measuring</em> either the Flavour or the
Odour of bodies which possess such qualities.</p>
<p id="b4c4s22">22. <i>Quality of Sounds.</i>&#8212;The same is true of that kind
of difference in sounds which is peculiarly termed their
<i>Quality</i>; that character by which, for instance, the
sound of a flute differs from that of a hautbois, when the
note is the same; or a woman’s voice from a boy’s.</p>
<p id="b4c4s23">23. <i>Articulate Sounds.</i>&#8212;There is also in sounds
another difference, of which the nature is still obscure,
but in reducing which to rule, and consequently to measure,
some progress has nevertheless been made. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page355">355</a></span> I speak of
the differences of sound considered as <i>articulate</i>.
Classifications of the sounds of the usual alphabets have
been frequently proposed; for instance, that which arranges
the <i>Consonants</i> in the following groups:</p>
<table class="cons">
<thead><tr>
<th>Sharp.</th><th>Flat.</th><th>Sharp Aspirate.</th><th>Flat Aspirate.</th><th> Nasal.</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>p</td><td>b</td><td>ph (<i>f</i>)</td><td>bh (<i>v</i>)</td><td>m</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>k</td><td>g (hard)</td><td>kh</td><td>gh</td><td>ng</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>t</td><td>d</td><td>th (sharp)</td><td>th (flat)</td><td>n</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>s</td><td>z</td><td>sh</td><td>zh</td><td></td></tr></tbody>
</table>
<p class="noind">It is easily perceived that the relations of the sounds in
each of these horizontal lines are analogous; and
accordingly the rules of derivation and modification of
words in several languages proceed upon such analogies. In
the same manner the <i>Vowels</i> may be arranged in an
order depending on their sound. But to make such
arrangements fixed and indisputable, we ought to know the
mechanism by which such modifications are caused.
Instruments have been invented by which some of these sounds
can be imitated; and if such instruments could be made to
produce the above series of articulate sounds, by connected
and regular processes, we should find, in the process, a
<i>measure</i> of the sound produced. This has been in a
great degree effected for the Vowels by Professor Willis’s
artificial mode of imitating them. For he finds that if a
musical reed be made to sound through a cylindrical pipe, we
obtain by gradually lengthening the cylindrical pipe, the
series of vowels <span class="sc">i, e, a, o, u</span>, with intermediate
sounds<a id="fnanchor38-4" href="#note38-4"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a>. In this instrument, then, the length of the
pipe would determine the vowel, and might be used
numerically to express it. Such an instrument so employed
would be a measure of vowel quality, and might be called a
<i>Phthongometer</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-4" href="#fnanchor38-4">38</a></span> <i>Camb. Trans.</i> vol. iii. p. 239.</div>
<p>Our business at present, however, is not with instruments
which might be devised for measuring sensible qualities, but
with those which have been so used, and have thus been the
basis of the sciences in which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page356">356</a></span> such qualities are
treated of; and this we have now done sufficiently for our
present purpose.</p>
<p id="b4c4s24">24. There is another Idea which, though hitherto very
vaguely entertained, has had considerable influence in the
formation, both of the sciences spoken of in the present
Book, and on others which will hereafter come under our
notice: namely, the Idea of Polarity. This Idea will be the
subject of the ensuing Book. And although this Idea forms a
part of the basis of various other extensive portions of
science, as Optics and Chemistry, it occupies so peculiarly
conspicuous a place in speculations belonging to what I have
termed the Mechanico-Chemical Sciences, (Magnetism and
Electricity,) that I shall designate the discussion of the
Idea of Polarity as the Philosophy of those Sciences.</p>

<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>N
some of the mechanical sciences, as Magnetism and
Optics, the phenomena are found to depend upon position (the
position of the magnet, or of the ray of light,) in a
peculiar alternate manner. This dependence, as it was first
apprehended, was represented by means of certain conceptions
of space and force, as for instance by considering the two
<i>Poles</i> of a magnet. But in all such modes of
representing these alternations by the conceptions borrowed
from other ideas, a closer examination detected something
superfluous and something defective; and in proportion as
the view which philosophers took of this relation was
gradually purified from these incongruous elements, and was
rendered more general and abstract by the discovery of
analogous properties in new cases, it was perceived that the
relation could not be adequately apprehended without
considering it as involving a peculiar and independent Idea,
which we may designate by the term <i>Polarity</i>.</p>
<p>We shall trace some of the forms in which this Idea has
manifested itself in the history of science. In doing so we
shall not begin, as in other Books of this work we have
done, by speaking of the notion as it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page360">360</a></span> employed in
common use: for the relation of Polarity is of so abstract
and technical a nature, that it is not employed, at least in
any distinct and obvious manner, on any ordinary or
practical occasions. The idea belongs peculiarly to the
region of speculation: in persons of common habits of
thought it is probably almost or quite undeveloped; and even
most of those whose minds have been long occupied by
science, find a difficulty in apprehending it in its full
generality and abstraction, and stript of all irrelevant
hypothesis.</p>
<p id="b5c1s2">2. <i>Magnetism.</i>&#8212;The name and the notion of
<i>Poles</i> were first adopted in the case of a magnet. If
we have two magnets, their extremities attract and repel
each other alternatively. If the first end of the one
attract the first end of the other, it repels the second
end, and conversely. In order to express this rule
conveniently, the two ends of each magnet are called the
<i>north pole</i> and the <i>south pole</i> respectively,
the denominations being borrowed from the poles of the earth
and heavens. ‘These poles,’ as Gilbert says<a id="fnanchor1-5" href="#note1-5"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>, ‘regulate
the motions of the celestial spheres and of the earth. In
like manner the magnet has its poles, a northern and a
southern one; certain and determined points constituted by
nature in the stone, the primary terms of its motions and
effects, the limits and governors of many actions and
virtues.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-5" href="#fnanchor1-5">1</a></span> <i>De Magn.</i> lib. i. c. iii.</div>
<p>The nature of the opposition of properties of which we speak
may be stated thus:<br/>
&#8195;The North pole of one magnet attracts the South pole of
another magnet.<br/>
&#8195;The North pole of one magnet <em>repels</em> the North pole
of another magnet.<br/>
&#8195;The South pole of one magnet repels the South pole of another
magnet.<br/>
&#8195;The South pole of one magnet <em>attracts</em> the North pole
of another magnet.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the contrariety of position which
is indicated by putting the South pole for the North pole in
either magnet, is accompanied by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page361">361</a></span> opposition of
mechanical effect which is expressed by changing attraction
into repulsion and repulsion into attraction: and thus we
have the general feature of Polarity,&#8212;A contrast of
properties corresponding to a contrast of positions.</p>
<p id="b5c1s3">3. <i>Electricity.</i>&#8212;When the phenomena of Electricity
came to be studied, it appeared that they involved relations
in some respects Analogous to those of magnetism.</p>
<p>Two kinds of electricity were distinguished, the positive
and the negative; and it appeared that two bodies electrized
positively, or two electrized negatively, repelled each
other, like two north or two south magnetic poles; while a
positively and a negatively electrized body attracted each
other, like the north and south poles of two magnets. In
conductors of an oblong form, the electricity could easily
be made to distribute itself so that one end should be
positively and one end negatively electrized; and then such
conductors acted on each other exactly as magnets would do.</p>
<p>But in conductors, however electrized, there is no peculiar
point which can permanently be considered as the
<em>pole</em>. The distribution of electricity in the
conductor depends upon external circumstances: and thus,
although the phenomena offer the general character of
<i>polarity</i>&#8212;alternative results corresponding to
alternative positions,&#8212;they cannot be referred to poles.
Some other mode of representing the forces must be adopted
than that which makes them emanate from permanent points as
in a magnet.</p>
<p>The phenomena of attraction and repulsion in electrized
bodies were conveniently represented by means of the
hypothesis of <em>two</em> electric <em>fluids</em>, a
positive and a negative one, which were supposed to be
distributed in the bodies. Of these fluids, it was supposed
that each repelled its own parts and attracted those of the
opposite fluid: and it was found that this hypothesis
explained all the obvious laws of electric action. Here then
we have the phenomena of polarization explained by a new
kind of machinery:&#8212;two opposite fluids <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page362">362</a></span> distributed in
bodies, and supplying them, so to speak, with their polar
forces. This hypothesis not only explains electrical
attraction, but also the electrical spark: namely, thus:
when two bodies, of which the neighbouring surfaces are
charged with the two opposite fluids, approach near to each
other, the mutual attraction of the fluids becomes more and
more intense, till at last the excess of fluid on the one
body breaks through the air and rushes to the other body, in
a form accompanied by light and noise. When this transfer
has taken place, the attraction ceases, the positive and the
negative fluid having neutralized each other. Their effort
was to unite; and this union being effected, there is no
longer any force in action. Bodies in their natural
unexcited condition may be considered as occupied by a
combination of the two fluids: and hence we see how the
production of either kind of electricity is necessarily
accompanied with the production of an equivalent amount of
the opposite kind.</p>
<p id="b5c1s4">4. <i>Voltaic Electricity.</i>&#8212;Such is the case in
Franklinic electricity,&#8212;that which is excited by the common
electrical machine. In studying Voltaic electricity, we are
led to the conviction that the fluid which is in a condition
of momentary <em>equilibrium</em> in electrized conductors,
exists in the state of a <em>Current</em> in the voltaic
circuit. And here we find polar relations of a new kind
existing among the forces. Two voltaic Currents
<em>attract</em> each other when they are moving in the
<em>same</em>, and <em>repel</em> each other when they are
moving in <em>opposite</em>, directions.</p>
<p>But we find, in addition to these, other polar relations of
a more abstruse kind, and which the supposition of two
fluids does not so readily explain. For instance, if such
fluids existed, distinct from each other, it might be
expected that it would be possible to exhibit one of them
separate from the other. Yet in all the phenomena of
electromotive currents, we attempt in vain to obtain one
kind of electricity separately. ‘I have not,’ says Mr.
Faraday<a id="fnanchor2-5" href="#note2-5"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>, ‘been able to find a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page363">363</a></span> single fact which
could be adduced to prove the theory of two electricities
rather than one, in electric currents; or, admitting the
hypothesis of two electricities, have I been able to
perceive the slightest grounds that one electricity can be
more powerful than the other, or that it can be present
without the other, or that it can be varied or in the
slightest degree affected without a corresponding variation
in the other.’ ‘Thus,’ he adds, ‘the polar character of the
powers is rigorous and complete.’ Thus, we too may remark,
all the superfluous and precarious parts gradually drop off
from the hypothesis which we devise in order to represent
polar phenomena; and the abstract notion of Polarity&#8212;of
equal and opposite powers called into existence by a common
condition&#8212;remains unincumbered with extraneous machinery.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-5" href="#fnanchor2-5">2</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, 516.</div>
<p id="b5c1s5">5. <i>Light.</i>&#8212;Another very important example of the
application of the Idea of Polarity is that supplied by the
discovery of the polarization of light. A ray of light may,
by various processes, be modified, so that it has different
properties according to its different <i>sides</i>, although
this difference is not perceptible by any common effects.
If, for instance, a ray thus modified, pass perpendicularly
through a circular glass, and fall upon the eye, we may turn
the glass round and round in its frame, and we shall make no
difference in the brightness of the spot which we see. But
if, instead of a glass, we look through a longitudinal slice
of tourmaline, the spot is alternately dark and bright as we
turn the crystal through successive quadrants. Here we have
a contrast of Properties (dark and bright) corresponding to
a contrast of positions, (the position of a line east and
west being contrasted with the position north and south,)
which, as we have said, is the general character of
Polarity. It was with a view of expressing this character
that the term <i>Polarization</i> was originally introduced.
Malus was forced by his discoveries into the use of this
expression. ‘We find,’ he says, in 1811, ‘that light
acquires properties which are relative only to the sides of
the ray,&#8212;which are the same for the north and south sides
of the ray, (using <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page364">364</a></span> the points of the compass for
description’s sake only,) and which are different when we go
from the north and south to the east or to the west sides of
the ray. I shall give the name of <i>poles</i> to these
sides of the ray, and shall call <i>polarization</i> the
modification which gives to light these properties relative
to these poles. I have <em>put off</em> hitherto the
admission of this term into the description of the physical
phenomena with which we have to do: I did not <em>dare</em>
to introduce it into the Memoirs in which I published my
last observations: but the variety of forms in which this
new phenomenon appears, and the difficulty of describing
them, compel me to admit this new expression; which
signifies simply the modification which light has undergone
in acquiring new properties which are not relative to the
direction of the ray, but only to its sides considered at
right angles to each other, and in a plane perpendicular to
its direction.’</p>
<p>The theory which represents light as an emission of
particles was in vogue at the time when Malus published his
discoveries; and some of his followers in optical research
conceived that the phenomena which he thus described
rendered it necessary to ascribe poles and an axis to each
particle of light. On this hypothesis, light would be
polarized when the axes of all the particles were in the
same direction: and, making such a supposition, it may
easily be conceived capable of transmission through a
crystal whose axis is parallel to that of the luminous
particles, and intransmissible when the axis of the crystal
is in a position transverse to that of the particles.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of particles possessing <i>poles</i> is a
rude and arbitrary assumption, in this as in other cases;
but it serves to convey the general notion of polarity,
which is the essential feature of the phenomena. The term
‘polarization of light  has sometimes been complained of in
modern times as hypothetical and obscure. But the real cause
of obscurity was, that the Idea of Polarity was, till
lately, very imperfectly developed in men’s minds. As we
have seen, the general notion of Polarity,&#8212;opposite
properties in opposite <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page365">365</a></span> directions,&#8212;exactly describes
the character of the optical phenomena to which the term is
applied.</p>
<p>It is to be recollected that in optics we never speak of the
<i>poles</i>, but of the <i>plane of polarization</i> of a
ray. The word <i>sides</i>, which Newton and Malus have
used, neither of them appears to have been satisfied with;
Newton, in employing it, had recourse to the strange
Gallicism of speaking of the <i>coast</i> of usual and of
unusual refraction of a crystal.</p>
<p>The modern theory of optics represents the plane of
polarization of light as depending, not on the position in
which the axes of the luminiferous particles lie, but on the
<em>direction</em> of those <em>transverse vibrations</em>
in which light consists. This theory is, as we have stated
in the History, recommended by an extraordinary series of
successes in accounting for the phenomena. And this
hypothesis of transverse vibrations shows us another
mechanical mode, (besides the hypothesis of particles with
axes,) by which we may represent the polarity of a ray. But
we may remark that the general notion of Polarity, as
applied to light in such cases, would subsist, even if the
undulatory theory were rejected. The idea is, as we have
before said, independent of all hypothetical machinery.</p>
<p>I need not here refer to the various ways in which light may
be polarized; as, for instance, by being reflected from the
surface of water, or of glass, at certain angles, by being
transmitted, through crystals, and in other ways. In all
cases the modification produced, the polarization, is
identically the same property. Nor need I mention the
various kinds of phenomena which appear as contrasts in the
result; for these are not merely light and dark, or white
and black, but red and green, and generally, a colour and
its <em>complementary</em> colour, exhibited in many complex
and varied configurations. These multiplied modes in which
polarized light presents itself add nothing to the original
conception of Polarization: and I shall therefore pass on to
another subject.</p>
<p id="b5c1s6">6. <i>Crystallization.</i>&#8212;Bodies which are perfectly
crystallized exhibit the most complete regularity and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page366">366</a></span>
symmetry of form; and this regularity not only appears in
their outward shape, but pervades their whole texture, and
manifests itself in their cleavage, their transparency, and
in the uniform and determinate optical properties which
exist in every part, even in the smallest fragment of the
mass. If we conceive crystals as composed of particles, we
must suppose these particles to be arranged in the most
regular manner; for example, if we suppose each particle to
have an axis, we must suppose all these axes to be parallel;
for the direction of the axis of the particles is indicated
by the physical and optical properties of the crystal, and
therefore this direction must be the same for every portion
of the crystal. This parallelism of the axes of the
particles may be conceived to result from the circumstance
of each particle having poles, the opposite poles attracting
each other. In virtue of forces acting as this hypothesis
assumes, a collection of small <em>magnetic</em> particles
would arrange themselves in parallel positions; and such a
collection of magnetic particles offers a sort of image of a
crystal. Thus we are led to conceive the particles of
crystals as polarized, and as determined in their
crystalline positions by polar forces. This mode of
apprehending the constitution of crystals has been adopted
by some of our most eminent philosophers. Thus Berzelius
says<a id="fnanchor3-5" href="#note3-5"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>, ‘It is demonstrated, that the regular forms of
bodies presuppose an effort of their atoms to touch each
other by preference in certain points; that is, they are
founded upon a Polarity;’&#8212;he adds, ‘a polarity which can be
no other than an electric or magnetic polarity.’ In this
latter clause we have the identity of different kinds of
polarity asserted; a principle which we shall speak of in
the next chapter. But we may remark, that even without
dwelling upon this connexion, any notion which we can form
of the structure of Crystals necessarily involves the idea
of Polarity. Whether this polarity necessarily requires us
to believe crystals to be composed of Atoms which exert an
effort to touch <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page367">367</a></span> each other in certain points by
preference, is another question. And, in agreement with what
has been said respecting other kinds of polarity, we shall
probably find, on a more profound examination of the
subject, that while the Idea of Polarity is essential, the
machinery by which it is thus expressed is precarious and
superfluous.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-5" href="#fnanchor3-5">3</a></span> <i>Essay on the Theory of Chemical
Properties</i>, 1820, p. 113.</div>
<p id="b5c1s7">7. <i>Chemical Affinity.</i>&#8212;We shall have, in the next
<a href="#v2page1">Book</a>, to speak of Chemical Affinity at some length; but
since the ultimate views to which philosophers have been
led, induce them to consider the forces of Affinity as Polar
Forces, we must enumerate these among the examples of
Polarity. In chemical processes, opposites tend to unite,
and to neutralize each other by their union. Thus an
<em>acid</em> or an <em>alkali</em> combine with vehemence,
and form a compound, a neutral salt, which is neither acid
nor alkaline.</p>
<p>This conception of contrariety and mutual neutralization,
involves the Idea of Polarity. In the conception as
entertained by the earlier chemists, the Idea enters very
obscurely: but in the attempts which have more recently been
made to connect this relation (of acid and base), with other
relations, the chemical elements have been conceived as
composed of particles which possess poles; <em>like</em>
poles repelling, and <em>unlike</em> attracting each other,
as they do in magnetic and electric phenomena. This is,
however, a rude and arbitrary way of expressing Polarity,
and, as may be easily shown, involves many difficulties
which do not belong to the Idea itself. Mr. Faraday, who has
been led by his researches to a conviction of the polar
nature of the forces of chemical affinity, has expressed
their character in a more general manner, and without any of
the machinery of particles indued with poles. According to
his view, chemical synthesis and analysis must always be
conceived as taking place in virtue of equal and opposite
forces, by which the particles are united or separated.
These forces, by the very circumstance of their being polar,
may be transferred from point to point. For if we conceive a
string of particles, and if the positive force of the first
particle <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page368">368</a></span> be liberated and brought into action, its
negative force also must be set free: this negative force
neutralizes the positive force of the next particle, and
therefore the negative force of this particle (before
employed in neutralizing its positive force) is set free:
this is in the same way transferred to the next particle,
and so on. And thus we have a positive force active at one
extremity of a line of particles, corresponding to a
negative force at the other extremity, all the intermediate
particles reciprocally neutralizing each other’s action.
This conception of the transfer of chemical action was
indeed at an earlier period introduced by Grotthus<a id="fnanchor4-5" href="#note4-5"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>, and
confirmed by Davy. But in Mr. Faraday’s hands we see it
divested of all that is superfluous, and spoken of, not as a
line of particles, but as ‘an axis of power, having [at
every point] contrary forces, exactly equal, in opposite
directions.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-5" href="#fnanchor4-5">4</a></span> <span class="sc">Dumas</span>, <i>Leçons sur la Philosophie Chimique</i>,
p. 401.</div>
<p id="b5c1s8">8. <i>General Remarks.</i>&#8212;Thus, as we see, the notion of
Polarity is applicable to many large classes of phenomena.
Yet the Idea in a distinct and general form is only of late
growth among philosophers. It has gradually been abstracted
and refined from many extraneous hypotheses which were at
first supposed to be essential to it. We have noticed some
of these hypotheses;&#8212;as the poles of a <i>body</i>; the
poles of the <i>particles</i> of a fluid; <i>two</i>
opposite fluids; a single fluid in <i>excess</i> and
<i>defect</i>; transverse <i>vibrations</i>. To these others
might be added. Thus Dr. Prout<a id="fnanchor5-5" href="#note5-5"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a> assumes that the
polarity of molecules results from their <i>rotation</i> on
their axes, the opposite motions of contiguous molecules
being the cause of opposite (positive and negative)
polarities.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-5" href="#fnanchor5-5">5</a></span> <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, p. 559.</div>
<p>But none of these hypotheses can be proved by the fact of
Polarity alone; and they have been in succession rejected
when they had been assumed on that ground. Thus Davy, in
1826, speaking of chemical forces says<a id="fnanchor6-5" href="#note6-5"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>, ‘In assuming
the idea of two ethereal, subtile, elastic <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page369">369</a></span> fluids,
attractive of the particles of each other, and repulsive as
to their own particles, capable of combining in different
proportions with bodies, and according to their proportions
giving them their specific qualities and rendering them
equivalent masses, it would be natural to refer the action
of the poles to the repulsions of the substances combined
with the excess of one fluid, and the attractions of those
united to the excess of the other fluid; and a history of
the phenomena, not unsatisfactory to the reason, might in
this way be made out. But as it is possible likewise to take
an entirely different view of the subject, on the idea of
the dependence of the results upon the primary attractive
powers of the parts of the combination on a single subtile
fluid, I shall not enter into any discussion on this obscure
part of the theory.’ Which of these theories will best
represent the case, will depend upon the consideration of
other facts, in combination with the polar phenomena, as we
see in the history of optical theory. In like manner Mr.
Faraday proved by experiment<a id="fnanchor7-5" href="#note7-5"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> the errour of all theories
which ascribe electro-chemical decomposition to the
attraction of the poles of the voltaic battery.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-5" href="#fnanchor6-5">6</a></span> <i>Phil. Tr.</i> 1826, p. 415.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-5" href="#fnanchor7-5">7</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, p. 495, &amp;c.</div>
<p>In order that they may distinctly image to themselves the
Idea of Polarity, men clothe it in some of the forms of
machinery above spoken of; yet every new attempt shows them
the unnecessary difficulties in which they thus involve
themselves. But on the other hand it is difficult to
apprehend this Idea divested of all machinery; and to
entertain it in such a form that it shall apply at the same
time to magnetism and electricity, galvanism and chemistry,
crystalline structure and light. The Idea of <i>Polarity</i>
becomes most pure and genuine, when we entirely reject the
conception of <i>Poles</i>, as Faraday has taught us to do
in considering electro-chemical decomposition; but it is
only by degrees and by effort that we can reach this point
of abstraction and generality. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page370">370</a></span></p>
<p id="b5c1s9">9. There is one other remark which we may here make. It was
a maxim commonly received in the ancient schools of
philosophy, that ‘Like attracts Like:’ but as we have seen,
the universal maxim of Polar Phenomena is, that Like
<em>repels</em> Like, and attracts Unlike. The north pole
attracts the south pole, the positive fluid attracts the
negative fluid; opposite elements rush together; opposite
motions reduce each other to rest. The permanent and stable
course of things is that which results from the balance and
neutralization of contrary tendencies. Nature is constantly
labouring after repose by the effect of such tendencies; and
so far as Polar Forces enter into her economy, she seeks
harmony by means of discord, and unity by opposition.</p>
<p>Although the Idea of Polarity is as yet somewhat vague and
obscure, even in the minds of the cultivators of physical
science, it has nevertheless given birth to some general
principles which have been accepted as evident, and have had
great influence on the progress of science. These we shall
now consider.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page371"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Connexion of Polarities.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b5c2s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>T
has appeared in the preceding chapter that in cases in
which the phenomena suggest to us the idea of Polarity, we
are also led to assume some material machinery as the mode
in which the polar forces are exerted. We assume, for
instance, globular particles which possess poles, or the
vibrations of a fluid, or two fluids attracting each other;
in every case, in short, some hypothesis by which the
existence and operation of the Polarity is embodied in
geometrical and mechanical properties of a medium; nor is it
possible for us to avoid proceeding upon the conviction that
some such hypothesis must be true; although the nature of
the connexion between the mechanism and the phenomena must
still be indefinite and arbitrary.</p>
<p>But since each class of Polar Phenomena is thus referred to
an ulterior cause, of which we know no more than that it has
a polar character, it follows that <em>different</em>
Polarities may result from the <em>same</em> cause
manifesting its polar character under different aspects.
Taking, for example, the hypothesis of globular particles,
if electricity result from an action dependent upon the
<em>poles</em> of each globule, magnetism may depend upon an
action in the <em>equator</em> of each globule; or taking
the supposition of transverse vibrations, if polarized light
result directly from such <em>vibrations</em>,
crystallization may have reference to the <em>axes</em> of
the elasticity of the <em>medium</em> by which the
vibrations are rendered transverse,&#8212;so far as the polar
character only of the phenomena is to be accounted for. I
say this <em>may</em> be so, <em>in so far</em> only as the
polar character of the phenomena is concerned; for whether
the relation of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page372">372</a></span> electricity to magnetism, or of
crystalline forces to light, can really be explained by such
hypotheses, remains to be determined by the facts
themselves. But since the first necessary feature of the
hypothesis is, that it shall give polarity, and since an
hypothesis which does this, may, by its mathematical
relations, give polarities of different kinds and in
different directions, any two co-existent kinds of polarity
may result from the same cause, manifesting itself in
various manners.</p>
<p>The conclusion to which we are led by these general
considerations is, that two co-existing classes of polar
phenomena <em>may</em> be effects of the same cause. But
those who have studied such phenomena more deeply and
attentively have, in most or in all cases, arrived at the
conviction that the various kinds of Polarity in such cases
<em>must</em> be connected and fundamentally identical. As
this conviction has exercised a great influence, both upon
the discoveries of new facts and upon the theoretical
speculations of modern philosophers, and has been put
forward by some writers as a universal principle of science,
I will consider some of the cases in which it has been thus
applied.</p>
<p id="b5c2s2">2. <i>Connexion of Magnetic and Electric Polarity.</i>&#8212;The
polar phenomena of electricity and magnetism are clearly
analogous in their laws: and obvious facts showed at an
early period that there was some connexion between the two
agencies. Attempts were made to establish an evident and
definite relation between the two kinds of force, which
attempts proceeded upon the principle now under
consideration;&#8212;namely, that in such cases, the two kinds of
Polarity must be connected. Professor Œrsted, of Copenhagen,
was one of those who made many trials founded upon this
conviction: yet all these were long unsuccessful. At length,
in 1820, he discovered that a galvanic current, passing at
right angles near to a magnetic needle, exercises upon it a
powerful deflecting force. The connexion once detected
between magnetism and galvanism was soon recognized as
constant and universal. It was represented in different
hypothetical modes by different persons; some considering
the galvanic <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page373">373</a></span> current as the primitive axis, and the
magnet as constituted of galvanic currents passing round it
at right angles to the magnetic axis; while others conceived
the magnetic axis as the primitive one, and the electric
current as implying a magnetic current round the wire. So
far as many of the general relations of these two kinds of
force were concerned, either mode of representation served
to express them; and thus the assumption that the two
Polarities, the magnetic and the electric, were
fundamentally identical, was verified, so far as the
phenomena of magnetic attraction, and the like, were
concerned.</p>
<p>I need not here mention how this was further confirmed by
the experiments in which, by means of the forces thus
brought into view, a galvanic wire was made to revolve round
a magnet, and a magnet round a galvanic wire;&#8212;in which
artificial magnets were constructed of coils of galvanic
wire;&#8212;and finally, in which the galvanic spark was obtained
from the magnet. The identity which sagacious speculators
had divined even before it was discovered, and which they
had seen to be universal as soon as it was brought to light,
was completely manifested in every imaginable form.</p>
<p>The relation of the electric and magnetic Polarities was
found to be, that they were <em>transverse</em> to each
other, and this relation exhibited under various conditions
of form and position of the apparatus, gave rise to very
curious and unexpected perplexities. The degree of
complication which this relation may occasion, may be judged
of from the number of constructions and modes of conception
offered by Œrsted, Wollaston, Faraday, and others, for the
purpose of framing a technical memory of the results. The
magnetic polarity gives us the north and south poles of the
needle; the electric polarity makes the current positive and
negative; and these pairs of opposites are connected by
relations of situation, as above and below, right and left;
and give rise to the resulting motion of the needle one way
or the other. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page374">374</a></span></p>
<p id="b5c2s3">3. Ampère, by framing his hypotheses of the action of
voltaic currents and the constitution of magnets, reduced
all these technical rules to rigorous deductions from one
general principle. And thus the vague and obscure persuasion
that there <em>must</em> be <em>some</em> connexion between
Electricity and Magnetism, so long an idle and barren
conjecture, was unfolded into a complete theory, according
to which magnetic and electromotive actions are only two
different manifestations of the same forces; and all the
above-mentioned complex relations of polarities are reduced
to one single polarity, that of the electro-dynamic current.</p>
<p id="b5c2s4">4. As the Idea of Polarity was thus firmly established and
clearly developed, it became an instrument of reasoning.
Thus it led Ampère to maintain that the original or
elementary forces in electro-dynamic action could not be as
M. Biot thought they were, a statical <em>couple</em>, but
must be directly opposite to each other. The same idea
enabled Mr. Faraday to carry on with confidence such
reasonings as the following<a id="fnanchor8-5" href="#note8-5"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>: ‘No other known power has
like direction with that exerted between an electric current
and a magnetic pole; it is tangential, while all other
forces acting at a distance are direct. Hence if a magnetic
pole on one side of a revolving plate follow its course by
reason of its obedience to the tangential force exerted upon
it by the very current of electricity which it has itself
caused; a similar pole on the other side of the plate should
immediately set it free from this force; for the currents
which have to be formed by the two poles are in contrary
directions.’ And in Article 1114 of his <i>Researches</i>,
the same eminent philosopher infers that if electricity and
magnetism are considered as the results of a peculiar agent
or condition, exerted in determinate directions
perpendicular to each other, one must be by some means
convertible into the other; and this he was afterwards able
to prove to be the case in fact.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-5" href="#fnanchor8-5">8</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, 244.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page375">375</a></span> Thus the principle that the Co-existent Polarities of
magnetism and electricity are connected and fundamentally
identical, is not only true, but is far from being either
vague or barren. It has been a fertile source both of
theories which have, at present, a very great probability,
and of the discovery of new and striking facts. We proceed
to consider other similar cases.</p>
<p id="b5c2s5">5. <i>Connexion of Electrical and Chemical
Polarities.</i>&#8212;The doctrine that the chemical forces by
which the elements of bodies are held together or separated,
are identical with the polar forces of electricity, is a
great discovery of modern times; so great and so recent,
indeed, that probably men of science in general have hardly
yet obtained a clear view and firm hold of this truth. This
doctrine is now, however, entirely established in the minds
of the most profound and philosophical chemists of our time.
The complete development and confirmation of this as of
other great truths, was preceded by more vague and confused
opinions gradually tending to this point; and the progress
of thought and of research was impelled and guided, in this
as in similar cases, by the persuasion that these
co-existent polarities could not fail to be closely
connected with each other. While the ultimate and exact
theory to which previous incomplete and transitory theories
tended is still so new and so unfamiliar, it must needs be a
matter of difficulty and responsibility for a common reader
to describe the steps by which truth has advanced from point
to point. I shall, therefore, in doing this, guide myself
mainly by the historical sketches of the progress of this
great theory, which, fortunately for us, have been given us
by the two philosophers who have played by far the most
important parts in the discovery, Davy and Faraday.</p>
<p>It will be observed that we are concerned here with the
progress of theory, and not of experiment, except so far as
it is confirmatory of theory. In Davy’s Memoir<a id="fnanchor9-5" href="#note9-5"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> of 1826,
on the Relations of Electrical and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page376">376</a></span> Chemical Changes,
he gives the historical details to which I have alluded.
Already in 1802 he had conjectured that all chemical
decompositions might be polar. In 1806 he attempted to
confirm this conjecture, and succeeded, to his own
satisfaction, in establishing<a id="fnanchor10-5" href="#note10-5"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> that the combinations
and decompositions by electricity were referable to the law
of electrical attractions and repulsions; and advanced the
hypothesis (as he calls it), that chemical and electrical
attractions were produced by the same cause, acting in one
case on particles, in the other on masses. This hypothesis
was most strikingly confirmed by the author’s being able to
use electrical agency as a more powerful means of chemical
decomposition than any which had yet been applied.
‘Believing,’ he adds, ‘that our philosophical systems are
exceedingly imperfect, I never attached much importance to
this hypothesis; but having formed it after a copious
induction of facts, and having gained by the application of
it a number of practical results, and considering myself as
much the author of it as I was of the decomposition of the
alkalies, and having developed it in an elementary work as
far as the present state of chemistry seemed to allow, I
have never,’ he says, ‘criticised or examined the manner in
which different authors have adopted or explained it,
contented, if in the hands of others, it assisted the
arrangements of chemistry or mineralogy, or became an
instrument of discovery.’ When the doctrine had found an
extensive acceptance among chemists, attempts were made to
show that it had been asserted by earlier writers: and
though Davy justly denies all value to these pretended
anticipations, they serve to show, however dimly, the
working of that conviction of the Connexion of Co-existent
Properties which all along presided in men’s minds during
this course of investigation. ‘Ritter and Winterl have been
quoted,’ Davy says<a id="fnanchor11-5" href="#note11-5"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a>, ‘among other persons, as having
imagined or anticipated the relation between electrical
powers and chemical affinities before the discovery of the
pile <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page377">377</a></span> of Volta. But whoever will read with attention
Ritter’s “Evidence that Galvanic action exists in organised
nature,” and <span class="correction" title="emended from Winter’s">Winterl's</span> <i>Prolusiones ad Chemiam sæculi
decimi noni</i>, will find nothing to justify this
opinion.’ He then refers to the Queries of Newton at the end
of his Optics. ‘These,’ he says, ‘contain more grand and
speculative views that might be brought to bear upon this
question than any found in the works of modern electricians;
but it is very unjust to the experimentalists who by the
laborious application of new instruments, have discovered
novel facts and analogies, to refer them to any such
suppositions as that all attractions, chemical, electrical,
magnetical, and gravitative, may depend upon the same
cause.’ It is perfectly true, that such vague opinions,
though arising from that tendency to generalize which is the
essence of science, are of no value except so far as they
are both rendered intelligible, and confirmed by
experimental research.</p>

<p>The phenomena of chemical decomposition by means of the
voltaic pile, however, led other persons to views very
similar to those of Davy. Thus Grotthus in 1805<a id="fnanchor12-5" href="#note12-5"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>
published an hypothesis of the same kind. ‘The pile of
Volta,’ he says, ‘is an electrical magnet, of which each
element, that is, each pair of plates, has a positive and a
negative pole. The consideration of this polarity suggested
to me the idea that a similar polarity may come into play
between the elementary particles of water when acted upon by
the same electrical agent; and I avow that this thought was
for me a flash of light.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-5" href="#fnanchor12-5">12</a></span> <i>Ann. Chim.</i> lxviii. 54.</div>
<p id="b5c2s6">6. The thought, however, though thus brought into being, was
very far from being as yet freed from vagueness,
superfluities, and errours. I have elsewhere noticed<a id="fnanchor13-5" href="#note13-5"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>
Faraday’s remark on Davy’s celebrated Memoir of 1806; that
‘the mode of action by which the effects take place is
stated very generally, so generally, indeed, that probably a
dozen precise schemes of electro-chemical action might be
drawn up, differing <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page378">378</a></span> essentially from each other, yet
all agreeing with the statement there given.’ When Davy and
others proceeded to give a little more definiteness and
precision to the statement of their views, they soon
introduced into the theory features which it was afterwards
found necessary to abandon. Thus<a id="fnanchor14-5" href="#note14-5"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> both Davy, Grotthus,
Riffault, and Chompré, ascribed electrical decomposition to
the action of the <em>poles</em>, and some of them even
pretended to assign the proportion in which the force of the
pole diminishes as the distance from it increases. Faraday,
as I have already stated, showed that the polarity must be
considered as residing not only in what had till then been
called the <i>poles</i>, but at every point of the circuit.
He ascribed<a id="fnanchor15-5" href="#note15-5"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> electro-chemical decomposition to internal
forces, residing in the <em>particles</em> of the matter
under decomposition, not to external forces, exerted by the
poles. Hence he shortly afterwards<a id="fnanchor16-5" href="#note16-5"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> proposed to reject
the word <i>poles</i> altogether, and to employ instead, the
term <i>electrode</i>, meaning the doors or passages (of
whatever surface formed) by which the decomposed elements
pass out. What have been called the <i>positive</i> and
<i>negative</i> poles he further termed the <i>Anode</i> and
<i>Cathode</i>; and he introduced some other changes in
nomenclature connected with these. He then, as I have
related in the History<a id="fnanchor17-5" href="#note17-5"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>, invented the
Volta-electrometer, which enabled him to measure the
quantity of voltaic action, and this he found to be
identical with the quantity of chemical affinity; and he was
thus led to the clearest view of the truth towards which he
and his predecessors had so long been travelling, that
electrical and chemical forces are identical<a id="fnanchor18-5" href="#note18-5"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>.</p>

<p id="b5c2s7">7. It will, perhaps, be said that this beautiful train of
discovery was entirely due to experiment, and not to any
<i>à priori</i> conviction that co-existent polarities <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page379">379</a></span>
must be connected. I trust I have sufficiently stated that
such an <i>à priori</i> principle could not be proved, nor
even understood, without a most laborious and enlightened
use of experiment; but yet I think that the doctrine, when
once fully unfolded, exhibited clearly, and established as
true, takes possession of the mind with a more entire
conviction of its certainty and universality, in virtue of
the principle we are now considering. When the theory has
assumed so simple a form, it appears to derive immense
probability (to say the least) from its simplicity. Like the
laws of motion, when stated in its most general form, it
appears to carry with it its own evidence. And thus this
great theory borrows something of its character from the
Ideas which it involves, as well as from the Experiments by
which it was established.</p>
<p id="b5c2s8">8. We may find in many of Mr. Faraday’s subsequent
reasonings, clear evidence that this idea of the Connexion
of Polarities, as now developed, is not limited in its
application to facts already known experimentally, but, like
other ideas, determines the philosopher’s researches into
the unknown, and gives us the <em>form</em> of knowledge
even before we possess the <em>matter</em>. Thus, he says,
in his Thirteenth Series<a id="fnanchor19-5" href="#note19-5"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>, ‘I have long sought, and
still seek, for an effect or condition which shall be to
statical electricity what magnetic force is to current
electricity; for as the lines of discharge are associated
with a certain transverse effect, so it appeared to me
impossible but that the lines of tension or of inductive
action, which of necessity precede the discharge, should
also have their correspondent transverse condition or
effect.’ Other similar passages might be found.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-5" href="#fnanchor19-5">19</a></span> Art. 1658.</div>
<p>I will now consider another case to which we may apply the
Principle of Connected Polarities.</p>
<p id="b5c2s9">9. <i>Connexion of Chemical and Crystalline
Polarities.</i>&#8212;The close connexion between the Chemical
Affinity and the Crystalline Attraction of elements cannot
be overlooked. Bodies never crystallize but when their
elements combine chemically; and solid bodies which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page380">380</a></span>
combine, when they do it most completely and exactly, also
crystallize. The forces which <em>hold together</em> the
elements of a crystal of alum are the same forces which make
it a <em>crystal</em>. There is no distinguishing between
the two sets of forces.</p>
<p>Both <i>chemical</i> and <i>crystalline</i> forces are
<i>polar</i>, as we stated in the last chapter; but the
polarity in the two cases is of a different kind. The
polarity of chemical forces is then put in the most distinct
form, when it is identified with electrical polarity; the
polarity of the particles of crystals has reference to their
geometrical form. And it is clear that these two kinds of
polarity must be connected. Accordingly, Berzelius expressly
asserts<a id="fnanchor20-5" href="#note20-5"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a> the necessary identity of these two
polarities. ‘The regular forms of bodies suppose a polarity
which <em>can be</em> no other than an electric or magnetic
polarity.’ This being so seemingly inevitable, we might
expect to find the electric forces manifesting some relation
to the definite directions of crystalline forms. Mr. Faraday
tried, but in vain, to detect some such relation. He
attempted to ascertain<a id="fnanchor21-5" href="#note21-5"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> whether a cube of rock crystal
transmitted the electrical force of tension with different
intensity along and across the axis of the crystal. In the
first specimen there seemed to be some difference; but in
other experiments, made both with rock crystal and with calc
spar, this difference disappeared. Although therefore we may
venture to assert that there must be some very close
connexion between electrical and crystalline forces, we are,
as yet, quite ignorant what the nature of the connexion is,
and in what kind of phenomena it will manifest itself.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-5" href="#fnanchor20-5">20</a></span> <i>Essay on Chemical Prop.</i> 113.</div>

<p id="b5c2s10">10. <i>Connexion of Crystalline and Optical
Polarities.</i>&#8212;Crystals present to us <i>optical</i>
phenomena which have a manifestly polar character. The
double refraction, both of uniaxal and of biaxal crystals,
is always accompanied with opposite polarization of the two
rays; and in this and in other ways light is polarized in
directions dependent upon the axes of the crystalline form,
that is, on the directions of the polarities of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page381">381</a></span>
crystalline particles. The identity of these two kinds of
polarity (crystalline and optical) is too obvious to need
insisting on; and it is not necessary for us here to decide
by what hypothesis this identity may most properly be
represented. We may hereafter perhaps find ourselves
justified in considering the crystalline forces as
determining the <i>elasticity</i> of the luminiferous ether
to be different in <i>different directions</i> within the
crystal, and thus as determining the refraction and
polarization of the light which the crystal transmits. But
at present we merely note this case as an additional example
of the manifest connexion and fundamental identity of two
co-existent polarities.</p>
<p id="b5c2s11">11. <i>Connexion of Polarities in general.</i>&#8212;Thus we find
that the Connexion of different kinds of Polarities,
magnetic, electric, chemical, crystalline, and optical, is
certain as a truth of experimental science. We have
attempted to show further that in the minds of several of
the most eminent discoverers and philosophers, such a
conviction is something more than a mere empirical result:
it is a principle which has regulated their researches while
it was still but obscurely seen and imperfectly unfolded,
and has given to their theories a character of generality
and self-evidence which experience alone cannot bestow.</p>
<p>It will, perhaps, be said that these doctrines,&#8212;that
scientific researches may usefully be directed by principles
in themselves vague and obscure;&#8212;that theories may have an
evidence superior to and anterior to experience;&#8212;are
doctrines in the highest degree dangerous, and utterly at
variance with the soundest maxims of modern times respecting
the cultivation of science.</p>
<p>In the justice and wisdom of this caution I entirely agree:
and although I have shown that this principle of the
<i>Connexion of Polarities</i>, rightly interpreted and
established in each case by experiment, involves profound
and comprehensive truths; I think it no less important to
remark that, at least in the present stage of our knowledge,
we can make no use of this principle without taking care, at
every step, to determine by <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page382">382</a></span> clear and decisive
experiments, its proper meaning and application. All
endeavours to proceed otherwise have led, and must lead, to
ignorance and confusion. Attempts to deduce from our bare
Idea of Polarity, and our fundamental convictions respecting
the connexion of polarities, theories concerning the forces
which really exist in nature, can hardly have any other
result than to bewilder men’s minds, and to misdirect their
efforts.</p>
<p>So far, indeed, as this persuasion of a connexion among
apparently different kinds of agencies, impels men, engaged
in the pursuit of knowledge, to collect observations, to
multiply, repeat, and vary experiments, and to contemplate
the result of these in all aspects and relations, it may be
an occasion of the most important discoveries. Accordingly
we find that the great laws of phenomena which govern the
motions of the planets about the sun, were first discovered
by Kepler, in consequence of his scrutinizing the recorded
observations with an intense conviction of the existence of
geometrical and arithmetical harmonies in the solar system.
Perhaps we may consider the discovery of the connexion of
magnetism and electricity by Professor Œrsted in 1820, as an
example somewhat of the same kind; for he also was a
believer in certain comprehensive but undefined relations
among the properties of bodies; and in consequence of such
views entertained great admiration for the <i>Prologue to
the Chemistry of the Nineteenth Century</i>, of Winterl,
<a href="#v1page377">already</a> mentioned. M. Œrsted, in 1803, published a summary
of this work; and in so doing, praised the views of Winterl
as far more profound and comprehensive than those of
Lavoisier. Soon afterwards a Review of this publication
appeared in France<a id="fnanchor22-5" href="#note22-5"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>, in which it was spoken of as a
work only fit for the dark ages, and as the indication of a
sect which had for some time ‘ravaged Germany,’ and
inundated that country with extravagant and unintelligible
mysticism. It was, therefore, a kind of triumph to M. Œrsted
to be, after <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page383">383</a></span> some years’ labour, the author of one of
the most remarkable and fertile physical discoveries of his
time.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-5" href="#fnanchor22-5">22</a></span> <i>Ann. Chim.</i>, Tom. 1. (1804), p. 191.</div>
<p id="b5c2s12">12. It was not indeed without some reason that certain of
the German philosophers were accused of dealing in doctrines
vast and profound in their aspect, but, in reality,
indefinite, ambiguous, and inapplicable. And the most
prominent of such doctrines had reference to the principle
now under our consideration; they represented the properties
of bodies as consisting in certain polarities, and professed
to deduce, from the very nature of things, with little or no
reference to experiment, the existence and connexion of
these polarities. Thus Schelling, in his <i>Ideas towards a
Philosophy of Nature</i>, published in 1803, says<a id="fnanchor23-5" href="#note23-5"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>,
‘Magnetism is the universal act of investing Multiplicity
with Unity; but the universal form of the reduction of
Multiplicity to Unity is the Line, pure Longitudinal
Extension: hence Magnetism is determination of pure
Longitudinal Extension; and as this manifests itself by
absolute Cohesion, Magnetism is the determination of
absolute Cohesion.’ And as Magnetism was, by such reasoning,
conceived to be proved as a universal property of matter,
Schelling asserted it to be a confirmation of his views when
it was discovered that other bodies besides iron are
magnetic. In like manner he used such expressions as the
following<a id="fnanchor24-5" href="#note24-5"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>: ‘The threefold character of the Universal,
the Particular, and the Indifference of the two,&#8212;as
expressed in their Identity, is Magnetism, as expressed in
their Difference, is Electricity, and as expressed in the
Totality, is Chemical Process. Thus these forms are only one
form; and the Chemical Process is a mere transfer of the
three Points of Magnetism into the Triangle of Chemistry.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-5" href="#fnanchor23-5">23</a></span> P. 223.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-5" href="#fnanchor24-5">24</a></span> P. 486.</div>
<p>It was very natural that the chemists should refuse to
acknowledge, in this fanciful and vague language,
(delivered, however, it is to be recollected, in 1803,) an
anticipation of Davy’s doctrine of the identity of
electrical and chemical forces, or of Œrsted’s <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page384">384</a></span>
electro-magnetic agency. Yet it was perhaps no less natural
that the author of such assertions should look upon every
great step in the electro-chemical theory as an illustration
of his own doctrines. Accordingly we find Schelling
welcoming, with a due sense of their importance, the
discoveries of Faraday. When he heard of the experiment in
which electricity was produced from common magnetism, he
fastened with enthusiasm upon the discovery, even before he
knew any of its details, and proclaimed it at a public
meeting of a scientific body<a id="fnanchor25-5" href="#note25-5"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> as one of the most
important advances of modern science. We have (he thus
reasoned) three effects of polar forces;&#8212;Electro-chemical
Decomposition, Electrical Action, Magnetism. Volta and Davy
had confirmed experimentally the identity of the two former
agencies: Œrsted showed that a closed voltaic circuit
acquired magnetic properties: but in order to exhibit the
identity of electric and magnetic action it was requisite
that electric forces should be extricated from magnetic.
This great step Faraday, he remarked, had made, in producing
the electric spark by means of magnets.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-5" href="#fnanchor25-5">25</a></span> Ueber Faraday’s <i>Neueste Entdeckung</i>.
München. 1832.</div>
<p id="b5c2s13">13. Although conjectures and assertions of the kind thus put
forth by Schelling involve a persuasion of the pervading
influence and connexion of polarities, which persuasion has
already been confirmed in many instances, they involve this
principle in a manner so vague and ambiguous that it can
rarely, in such a form, be of any use or value. Such views
of polarity can never teach us in what cases we are and in
what we are not expected to find polar relations; and indeed
tend rather to diffuse error and confusion, than to promote
knowledge. Accordingly we cannot be surprized to find such
doctrines put forward by their authors as an evidence of the
small value and small necessity of experimental science.
This is done by the celebrated metaphysician Hegel, in his
<i>Encyclopædia</i><a id="fnanchor26-5" href="#note26-5"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>. ‘Since,’ <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page385">385</a></span> says he, ‘the
plane of incidence and of reflection in simple reflection is
the same plane, when a second reflector is introduced which
further distributes the illumination reflected from the
first, the position of the first plane with respect to the
second plane, containing the direction of the first
reflection and of the second, has its influence upon the
position, illumination or darkening of the object as it
appears by the second reflection. This influence must be the
strongest when the two planes are what we must call
<i>negatively</i> related to each other:&#8212;that is, when they
are at right angles.’ ‘But,’ he adds, ‘when men infer (as
Malus has done) from the modification which is produced by
this situation, in the illumination of the reflection, that
the molecules of light in themselves, that is, on their
different sides, possess different physical energies; and
when on this foundation, along with the phenomena of
entoptical colours therewith connected, a wide labyrinth of
the most complex theory is erected; we have then one of the
most remarkable examples of the <em>inferences</em> of
physics from experiment.’ If Hegel’s reasoning prove
anything, it must prove that polarization always accompanies
reflection under such circumstances as he describes: yet all
physical philosophers know that in the case of metals, in
which the reflection is most complete, light is not
completely polarized at any angle; and that in other
substances the polarization depends upon various
circumstances which show how idle and inapplicable is the
account which he thus gives of the property. His
self-complacent remark about the inferences of physics from
experiment, is intended to recommend by comparison his own
method of considering the nature of ‘things in themselves;’
a mode of obtaining physical truth which had been more than
exhausted by Aristotle, and out of which no new attempts
have extracted anything of value since his time.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-5" href="#fnanchor26-5">26</a></span> Sec. 278.</div>
<p id="b5c2s14">14. Thus the general conclusion to which we are led on this
subject, is, that the persuasion of the existence and
Connexion or Identity of various Polarities in nature,
although very naturally admitted, and in many <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page386">386</a></span> cases
interpreted and confirmed by observed facts, is of itself,
so far as we at present possess it, a very insecure guide to
scientific doctrines. When it is allowed to dictate our
theories, instead of animating and extending our
experimental researches, it leads only to errour, confusion,
obscurity, and mysticism.</p>
<p class="end">This Fifth Book, on the subject of Polarities, is a short
one compared with most of the others. This arises in a great
measure from the circumstance that the Idea of Polarity has
only recently been apprehended and applied, with any great
degree of clearness, among physical philosophers; and is
even yet probably entertained in an obscure and ambiguous
manner by most experimental inquirers. I have been desirous
of not attempting to bring forward any doctrines upon the
subject, except such as have been fully illustrated and
exemplified by the acknowledged progress of the physical
sciences. If I had been willing to discuss the various
speculations which have been published respecting the
universal prevalence of Polarities in the universe, and
their results in every province of nature, I might easily
have presented this subject in a more extended form; but
this would not have been consistent with my plan of tracing
the influence of scientific Ideas only so far as they have
really aided in disclosing and developing scientific truths.
And as the influence of this Idea is clearly distinguishable
both from those which precede and those which follow, in the
character of the sciences to which it gives rise, and as it
appears likely to be hereafter of great extent and
consequence, it seemed better to treat of it in a separate
Book, although of a brevity disproportioned to the rest.</p>

<p class="noind" id="b6c1s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>E have now to bring into view, if possible, the
Ideas and General Principles which are involved in Chemistry,&#8212;the science of the composition
of bodies. For in this as in other parts of human
knowledge, we shall find that there are certain Ideas,
deeply seated in the mind, though shaped and unfolded
by external observation, which are necessary conditions
of the existence of such a science. These Ideas it is,
which impel man to such a knowledge of the Composition of bodies, which give <em>meaning</em> to <em>facts</em> exhibiting
this composition, and <em>universality</em> to <em>special</em> truths
discovered by experience. These are the Ideas of
<i>Element</i> and of <i>Substance</i>.</p>
<p>Unlike the Idea of Polarity, of which we treated in
the last Book, these Ideas have been current in men’s
minds from very early times, and formed the subject
of some of the first speculations of philosophers. It
happened however, as might have been expected, that
in the first attempts they were not clearly distinguished
from other notions, and were apprehended and applied
in an obscure and confused manner. We cannot better
exhibit the peculiar character and meaning of these
Ideas than by tracing the form which they have assumed <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page4">4</a></span>
and the efficacy which they have exerted in these successive essays. This, therefore, I shall endeavour to
do, beginning with the Idea of Element.</p>
<p id="b6c1s2">2. That bodies are composed or made up of certain
parts, elements, or principles, is a conception which
has existed in men’s minds from the beginning of the
first attempts at speculative knowledge. The doctrine
of the Four Elements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water, of
which all things in the universe were supposed to be
constituted, is one of the earliest forms in which this
conception was systematized; and this doctrine is
stated by various authors to have existed as early as
the times of the ancient Egyptians<a id="fnanchor1-6" href="#note1-6"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>. The words usually
employed by Greek writers to express these elements
are ἀρχὴ a <i>principle</i> or <i>beginning</i>, and στοιχεῖον,
which probably meant a <i>letter</i> (of a word) before it
meant an <i>element</i> of a compound. For the resolution
of a word into its letters is undoubtedly a remarkable
instance of a successful analysis performed at an early
stage of man’s history; and might very naturally
supply a metaphor to denote the analysis of substances
into their intimate parts, when men began to contemplate such an analysis as a subject of speculation. The
Latin word <i>elementum</i> itself, though by its form it
appears to be a derivative abstract term, comes from
some root now obsolete; probably<a id="fnanchor2-6" href="#note2-6"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> from a word signifying <i>to grow</i> or <i>spring up</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-6" href="#fnanchor1-6">1</a></span>  Gilbert’s <i>Phys.</i> 1. i. c. iii.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-6" href="#fnanchor2-6">2</a></span> Vossius <i>in voce</i>. “Conjecto esse
ab antiqua voco <i>eleo</i> pro <i>oleo</i>, id est
<i>cresco</i>: a qua signiflcatione proles, <i>suboles</i>, <i>adolescens</i>: ut ab <i>juratum</i>, <i>juramentum</i>; ab <i>adjutum</i>, <i>adjumentum</i>:
sic ab <i>eletum</i>, <i>elementum</i>: quia inde
omnia crescunt ac nascuntur.”</div>
<p>The mode in which elements form the compound
bodies and determine their properties was at first, as
might be expected, vaguely and variously conceived. It
will, I trust, hereafter be made clear to the reader that
the relation of the elements to the compound involves
a peculiar and appropriate Fundamental Idea, not susceptible of being correctly represented by any comparison or combination of other ideas, and guiding us to
clear and definite results only when it is illustrated <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page5">5</a></span> and nourished by an abundant supply of experimental
facts. But at first the peculiar and special notion
which is required in a just conception of the constitution of bodies was neither discerned nor suspected;
and up to a very late period in the history of chemistry, men went on attempting to apprehend the constitution of bodies more clearly by substituting for this
obscure and recondite idea of Elementary Composition,
some other idea more obvious, more luminous, and
more familiar, such as the ideas of Resemblance, Position, and mechanical Force. We shall briefly speak
of some of these attempts, and of the errours which
were thus introduced into speculations on the relations
of elements and compounds.</p>
<p id="b6c1s3">3. <i>Compounds assumed to resemble their Elements.</i>&#8212;The
first notion was that compounds derive their qualities from
their elements by <em>resemblance</em>:&#8212;they are hot in
virtue of a hot element, heavy in virtue of a heavy element,
and so on. In this way the doctrine of the <i>four
elements</i> was framed; for every body is either hot or
cold, moist or dry; and by combining these qualities in all
possible ways, men devised four elementary substances, as
has been stated in the History<a id="fnanchor3-6" href="#note3-6"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-6" href="#fnanchor3-6">3</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. i. c. ii. sec. 2.</div>
<p>This assumption of the derivation of the qualities of
bodies from similar qualities in the elements was, as we
shall see, altogether baseless and unphilosophical, yet
it prevailed long and universally. It was the foundation of medicine for a long period, both in Europe and
Asia; disorders being divided into hot, cold, and the
like; and remedies being arranged according to similar
distinctions. Many readers will recollect, perhaps, the
story<a id="fnanchor4-6" href="#note4-6"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a> of the indignation which the Persian physicians
felt towards the European, when he undertook to
cure the ill effects of cucumber upon the patient, by
means of mercurial medicine: for cucumber, which is
cold, could not be counteracted, they maintained, by
mercury, which in their classification is cold also.
Similar views of the operation of medicines might <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page6">6</a></span> easily be traced in our own country. A moment’s
reflection may convince us that when drugs of any
kind are subjected to the chemistry of the human
stomach and thus made to operate on the human frame,
it is utterly impossible to form the most remote conjecture what the result will be, from any such vague
notions of their qualities as the common use of our
senses can give. And in like manner the common operations of chemistry give rise, in almost every instance,
to products which bear no resemblance to the materials
employed. The results of the furnace, the alembic, the
mixture, frequently have no visible likeness to the
ingredients operated upon. Iron becomes steel by the
addition of a little charcoal; but what visible trace of
the charcoal is presented by the metal thus modified?
The most beautiful colours are given to glass and
earthenware by minute portions of the ores of black
or dingy metals, as iron and manganese. The worker
in metal, the painter, the dyer, the vintner, the brewer,
all the artisans in short who deal with practical chemistry, are able to teach the speculative chemist that
it is an utter mistake to expect that the qualities of
the elements shall be still discoverable, in an unaltered
form, in the compound. This first rude notion of an
element, that it determines the properties of bodies <em>by
resemblance</em>, must be utterly rejected and abandoned
before we can make any advance towards a true apprehension of the constitution of bodies.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-6" href="#fnanchor4-6">4</a></span> See <i>Hadji Baba</i>.</div>
<p id="b6c1s4">4. This step accordingly was made, when the hypothesis of the four elements was given up, and the doctrine of the <i>three Principles</i>, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, was substituted in its place. For in making
this change, as I have remarked in the History<a id="fnanchor5-6" href="#note5-6"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>, the
real advance was the acknowledgment of the changes,
produced by the chemist’s operations, as results to be
accounted for by the union and separation of substantial elements, however great the changes, and however
unlike the product might be to the materials. And
this step once made, chemists went on constantly <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page7">7</a></span> advancing towards a truer view of the nature of an
element, and consequently, towards a more satisfactory
theory of chemical operations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-6" href="#fnanchor5-6">5</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. iv. c. 1.</div>
<p id="b6c1s5">5. Yet we may, I think, note one instance, even in
the works of eminent modern chemists, in which this
maxim, that we have no right to expect any resemblance between the elements and the compound, is lost
sight of. I speak of certain classifications of mineral
substances. Berzelius, in his System of Mineral Arrangement, places <i>sulphur</i> next to the <i>sulphurets</i>. But
surely this is an errour, involving the ancient assumption of the resemblance of elements and compounds;
as if we were to expect the sulphurets to bear a resemblance to sulphur. All classifications are intended
to bring together things resembling each other: the
sulphurets of metals have certain general resemblances
to each other which make them a tolerably distinct,
well determined, class of bodies. But sulphur has no
resemblances with these, and no analogies with them,
either in physical or even in chemical properties. It
is a simple body; and both its resemblances and its
analogies direct us to place it along with other simple
bodies, (selenium, and phosphorus,) which, united with
metals, produce compounds not very different from the
sulphurets. Sulphur cannot be, nor approach to being,
a sulphuret; we must not confound what it <em>is</em> with
what it <em>makes</em>. Sulphur has its proper influence in
determining the properties of the compound into which
it enters; but it does not do this according to resemblance of qualities, or according to any principle which
properly leads to propinquity in classification.</p>
<p id="b6c1s6">6. <i>Compounds assumed to be determined by the Figure of Elements.</i>&#8212;I pass over the fanciful modes of
representing chemical changes which were employed
by the Alchemists; for these strange inventions did
little in leading men towards a juster view of the relations of elements to compounds. I proceed for an
instant to the attempt to substitute another obvious
conception for the still obscure notion of elementary
composition. It was imagined that all the properties of bodies and their mutual operations might be <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page8">8</a></span> accounted for by supposing them constituted of <em>particles</em>
of various <em>forms</em>, round or angular, pointed or hooked,
straight or spiral. This is a very ancient hypothesis,
and a favourite one with many casual speculators in
all ages. Thus Lucretius undertakes to explain why
wine passes rapidly through a sieve and oil slowly, by
telling us that the latter substance has its particles
either larger than those of the other, or more hooked
and interwoven together. And he accounts for the
difference of sweet and bitter by supposing the particles in the former case to be round and smooth, in the
latter sharp and jagged<a id="fnanchor6-6" href="#note6-6"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>. Similar assumptions prevailed in modern times on the revival of the mechanical philosophy, and constitute a large part of the
physical schemes of Descartes and Gassendi. They
were also adopted to a considerable extent by the
chemists. Acids were without hesitation assumed to
consist of sharp pointed particles; which, ‘I hope,’
Lemery says<a id="fnanchor7-6" href="#note7-6"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>, ‘no one will dispute, seeing every one’s
experience does demonstrate it: he needs but taste an
acid to be satisfied of it, for it pricks the tongue like
anything keen and finely cut.’ Such an assumption
is not only altogether gratuitous and useless, but appears to be founded in some degree upon a confusion
in the metaphorical and literal use of such words as
<i>keen</i> and <i>sharp</i>. The assumption once made, it was
easy to accommodate it, in a manner equally arbitrary,
to other facts. ‘A demonstrative and convincing
proof that an acid does consist of pointed parts is, that
not only all acid salts do crystallize into edges, but all
dissolutions of different things, caused by acid liquors,
do assume this figure in their crystallization. These
crystals consist of points differing both in length and
bigness one from another, and this diversity must be
attributed to the keener or blunter edges of the different sorts of acids: and so likewise this difference of
the points in subtilty is the cause that one acid can
penetrate and dissolve with one sort of <i>mixt</i>, that another can’t rarify at all: Thus <i>vinegar</i> dissolves <i>lead</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page9">9</a></span> which <i>aqua fortis</i> can’t: <i>aqua fortis</i> dissolves <i>quicksilver</i>, which <i>vinegar</i> will not touch; <i>aqua regalis</i> dissolves <i>gold</i>, whenas <i>aqua fortis</i> cannot meddle with it;
on the contrary, <i>aqua fortis</i> dissolves <i>silver</i>, but can
do nothing with gold, and so of the rest.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-6" href="#fnanchor6-6">6</a></span> <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, ii. 390 sqq.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-6" href="#fnanchor7-6">7</a></span> <i>Chemistry</i>, p. 25.</div>
<p>The leading fact of the vehement combination and
complete union of acid and alkali readily suggested a
fit form for the particles of the latter class of substances. ‘This effect,’ Lemery adds, ‘may make us
reasonably conjecture that an alkali is a terrestrious
and solid matter whose forms are figured after such a
manner that the acid points entering in do strike and
divide whatever opposes their motion.’ And in a like
spirit are the speculations in Dr. Mead’s <i>Mechanical
Account of Poisons</i> (1745). Thus he explains the
poisonous effect of <i>corrosive sublimate</i> of mercury by
saying<a id="fnanchor8-6" href="#note8-6"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a> that the particles of the salt are a kind of
lamellæ or blades to which the mercury gives an additional weight. If resublimed with three-fourths the
quantity of mercury, it loses its corrosiveness, (becoming <i>calomel</i>,) which arises from this, that in sublimation ‘the crystalline blades are divided every time
more and more by the force of the fire:’ and ‘the
broken pieces of the crystals uniting into little masses
of differing figures from their former make, those cutting points are now so much smaller that they cannot
make wounds deep enough to be equally mischievous
and deadly: and therefore do only vellicate and twitch
the sensible membranes of the stomach.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-6" href="#fnanchor8-6">8</a></span> P. 199.</div>
<p id="b6c1s7">7. Among all this very fanciful and gratuitous assumption we may notice one true principle clearly
introduced, namely, that the suppositions which we
make respecting the forms of the elementary particles
of bodies and their mode of combination must be such
as to explain the facts of crystallization, as well as of
mere chemical change. This principle we shall hereafter have occasion to insist upon further.</p>
<p>I now proceed to consider a more refined form of
assumption respecting the constitution of bodies, yet <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page10">10</a></span> still one in which a vain attempt is made to substitute
for the peculiar idea of chemical composition a more
familiar mechanical conception.</p>
<p id="b6c1s8">8. <i>Compounds assumed to be determined by the Mechanical Attraction of the Elements.</i>&#8212;When, in consequence of the investigations and discoveries of Newton
and his predecessors, the conception of mechanical
force had become clear and familiar, so far as the
action of external forces upon a body was concerned, it
was very natural that the mathematicians who had
pursued this train of speculation should attempt to
apply the same conception to that mutual action of the
internal parts of a body by which they are held together. Newton himself had pointed the way to this
attempt. In the Preface to the <i>Principia</i>, after speaking of what he has done in calculating the effects of
forces upon the planets, satellites, &amp;e., he adds, ‘Would
it were permitted us to deduce the other phenomena
of nature from mechanical principles by the same kind
of reasoning. For many things move me to suspect
that all these phenomena depend upon certain forces,
by which the particles of bodies, through causes not
yet known, are either urged towards each other, and
cohere according to regular figures, or are repelled and
recede from each other; which forces being unknown,
philosophers have hitherto made their attempts upon
nature in vain.’ The same thought is at a later period
followed out further in one of the Queries at the end
of the Opticks<a id="fnanchor9-6" href="#note9-6"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a>. ‘Have not the small particles of
bodies certain Powers, Virtues, or Forces, by which
they act at a distance, not only upon the rays of light
for reflecting, refracting and inflecting them, but also
upon one another for producing a great part of the
phenomena of nature?’ And a little further on he
proceeds to apply this expressly to chemical changes.
‘When Salt of Tartar runs <i>per deliquium</i> [or as we
now express it, deliquesces] is not this done by an <em>attraction</em> between the particles of the Salt of Tartar
and the particles of the water which float in the air in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page11">11</a></span> the form of vapours? And why does not common salt,
or saltpetre, or vitriol, run <i>per deliquium</i>, but for want
of such an attraction? or why does not Salt of Tartar
draw more water out of the air than in a certain proportion to its quantity, but for want of an attractive
force after it is saturated with water?’ He goes on to
put a great number of similar cases, all tending to the
same point, that chemical combinations cannot be
conceived in any other way than as an attraction of
particles.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-6" href="#fnanchor9-6">9</a></span> Query 31.</div>
<p id="b6c1s9">9. Succeeding speculators in his school attempted
to follow out this view. Dr. Frend, of Christ Church,
in 1710, published his <i>Prælectiones Chymicæ, in quibus
omne fere Operationes Chymicæ ad vera Principia ex
ipsius Naturæ Legibus rediguntur. Oxonii habitæ</i>.
This book is dedicated to Newton, and in the dedication, the promise of advantage to chemistry from the
influence of the Newtonian discoveries is spoken of
somewhat largely,&#8212;much more largely, indeed, than
has yet been justified by the sequel. After declaring
in strong terms that the only prospect of improving
science consists in following the footsteps of Newton,
the author adds, ‘That force of attraction, of which
you first so successfully traced the influence in the
heavenly bodies, operates in the most minute corpuscles, as you long ago hinted in your <i>Principia</i>, and
have lately plainly shown in your <i>Opticks</i>; and this
force we are only just beginning to perceive and to
study. Under these circumstances I have been desirous of trying what is the result of this view in
chemistry.’ The work opens formally enough, with a
statement of general mechanical principles, of which
the most peculiar are these:&#8212;‘That there exists an attractive force by which particles when at very small
distances from each other, are drawn together;&#8212;that
this force is different, according to the different figure
and density of the particles;&#8212;that the force may be
greater on one side of a particle than on the other;&#8212;that the force by which particles cohere together arises
from attraction, and is variously modified according to
the quantity of contacts.’ But these principles are not <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page12">12</a></span> applied in any definite manner to the explanation of
specific phenomena. He attempts, indeed, the question of special solvents<a id="fnanchor10-6" href="#note10-6"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>. Why does <i>aqua fortis</i> dissolve silver and not gold, while <i>aqua regia</i> dissolves
gold and not silver? which, he says, is the most difficult question in chemistry, and which is certainly a
fundamental question in the formation of chemical
theory. He solves it by certain assumptions respecting
the forces of attraction of the particles, and also the
diameter of the particles of the acids and the pores of
the metals, all which suppositions are gratuitous.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-6" href="#fnanchor10-6">10</a></span> P. 54.</div>
<p id="b6c1s10">10. We may observe further, that by speaking, as
I have stated that he does, of the figure of particles,
he mixes together the assumption of the last section
with the one which we are considering in this. This
combination is very unphilosophical, or, to say the
least, very insufficient, since it makes a new hypothesis
necessary. If a body be composed of cubical particles,
held together by their mutual attraction, by what force
are the parts of each cube held together? In order to
understand their structure, we are obliged again to assume a cohesive force of the second order, binding together the particles of each particle. And therefore
Newton himself says<a id="fnanchor11-6" href="#note11-6"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a>, very justly, ‘The parts of all
homogeneal hard bodies which fully touch each other,
stick together very strongly: and for explaining how
this is, some have invented hooked atoms, <em>which is
begging the question</em>.’ For (he means to imply,) how do
the parts of the hook stick together?</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-6" href="#fnanchor11-6">11</a></span> <i>Opticks</i>, p. 364.</div>
<p>The same remark is applicable to all hypotheses in
which particles of a complex structure are assumed as
the constituents of bodies: for while we suppose bodies
and their known properties to result from the mutual
actions of these particles, we are compelled to suppose
the parts of each particle to be held together by forces
still more difficult to conceive, since they are disclosed
only by the properties of these particles, which as yet
are unknown. Yet Newton himself has not abstained
from such hypotheses: thus he says<a id="fnanchor12-6" href="#note12-6"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>, ‘A particle of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page13">13</a></span> a salt may be compared to a chaos, being dense, hard,
dry, and earthy in the center, and moist and watery
in the circumference.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-6" href="#fnanchor12-6">12</a></span> <i>Opticks</i>, p. 362.</div>
<p>Since Newton’s time the use of the term <i>attraction</i>,
as expressing the cause of the union of the chemical
elements of bodies, has been familiarly continued; and
has, no doubt, been accompanied in the minds of many
persons with an obscure notion that chemical attraction is, in some way, a kind of mechanical attraction
of the particles of bodies. Yet the doctrine that <em>chemical</em> ‘attraction’ and <em>mechanical</em> attraction are forces
of the same kind has never, so far as I am aware, been
worked out into a system of chemical theory; nor even
applied with any distinctness as an explanation of any
particular chemical phenomena. Any such attempt,
indeed, could only tend to bring more clearly into
view the entire inadequacy of such a mode of explanation. For the leading phenomena of chemistry are
all of such a nature that no mechanical combination
can serve to express them, without an immense accumulation of additional hypotheses. If we take as our
problem the changes of colour, transparency, texture,
taste, odour, produced by small changes in the ingredients, how can we expect to give a mechanical account
of these, till we can give a mechanical account of
colour, transparency, texture, taste, odour, themselves?
And if our mechanical hypothesis of the elementary
constitution of bodies does not explain <em>such</em> phenomena
as those changes, what can it explain, or what can be
the value of it? I do not here insist upon a remark
which will afterwards come before us, that even crystalline form, a phenomenon of a far more obviously
mechanical nature than those just alluded to, has never
yet been in any degree explained by such assumptions
as this, that bodies consist of elementary particles
exerting forces of the same nature as the central forces
which we contemplate in Mechanics.</p>
<p>When therefore Newton asks, ‘When some stones,
as spar of lead, dissolved in proper menstruums, become salts, do not these things show that salts are dry
earth and watery acid united by <em>attraction</em>?’ we may <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page14">14</a></span> answer, that this mode of expression appears to be
intended to identify chemical combination with mechanical attraction;&#8212;that there would be no objection to
any such identification, if we could, in that way, explain, or even classify well, a collection of chemical
facts; but that this has never yet been done by the
help of such expressions. Till some advance of this
kind can be pointed out, we must necessarily consider
the power which produces chemical combination as a
peculiar principle, a special relation of the elements,
not rightly expressed in mechanical terms. And we
now proceed to consider this relation under the name
by which it is most familiarly known.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Establishment and Development of the Idea of Chemical Affinity.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b6c2s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE earlier chemists did not commonly involve
themselves in the confusion into which the
mechanical philosophers ran, of comparing chemical to
mechanical forces. Their attention was engaged, and
their ideas were moulded, by their own pursuits. They
saw that the connexion of elements and compounds with
which they had to deal, was a peculiar relation which must
be studied directly; and which must be understood, if
understood at all, in itself, and not by comparison with
a different class of relations. At different periods of
the progress of chemistry, the conception of this relation, still vague and obscure, was expressed in various
manners; and at last this conception was clothed in
tolerably consistent phraseology, and the principles
which it involved were, by the united force of thought
and experiment, brought into view.</p>
<p id="b6c2s2">2. The power by which the elements of bodies
combine chemically, being, as we have seen, a peculiar
agency, different from mere mechanical connexion or
attraction, it is desirable to have it designated by a
distinct and peculiar name; and the term <i>Affinity</i> has
been employed for that purpose by most modern chemists. The word ‘affinity’ in common language means,
sometimes resemblance, and sometimes relationship
and ties of family. It is from the latter sense that the
metaphor is borrowed when we speak of ‘chemical
affinity.’ By the employment of this term we do not indicate a resemblance, but a disposition to unite. Using
the word in a common unscientific manner, we might
say that chlorine, bromine, and iodine, have a great <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page16">16</a></span> <i>natural affinity</i> with each other, for there are considerable resemblances and analogies among them; but
these bodies have very little <em>chemical</em> Affinity for each
other. The use of the word in the <i>former</i> sense, of resemblance, can be traced in earlier chemists; but the word
does not appear to have acquired its peculiar chemical
meaning till after Boerhaave’s time. Boerhaave, however, is the writer in whom we first find a due apprehension of the peculiarity and importance of the Idea
which it now expresses. When we make a chemical
solution<a id="fnanchor13-6" href="#note13-6"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>, he says, not only are the particles of the dissolved body separated from each other, but they are
closely united to the particles of the solvent. When
<i>aqua regia</i> dissolves gold, do you not see, he says to
his hearers, that there must be between each particle
of the solvent and of the metal, a mutual virtue by
which each loves, unites with, and holds the other
(<i>amat</i>, <i>unit</i>, <i>retinet</i>)? The opinion previously prevalent had been that the solvent merely separates the
parts of the body dissolved: and most philosophers
had conceived this separation as performed by mechanical operations of the particles, resembling, for instance, the operation of wedges breaking up a block of
timber. But Boerhaave forcibly and earnestly points
out the insufficiency of the conception. This, he says,
does not account for what we see. We have not only
a separation, but a new combination. There is a force
by which the particles of the solvent associate to themselves the parts dissolved, not a force by which they
repel and dissever them. We are here to imagine not
mechanical action, not violent impulse, not antipathy,
but love, at least if love be the desire of uniting. (Non
igitur hic etiam actiones mechanicæ, non propulsiones
violentæ, non inimicitiæ cogitandæ, sed amicitiæ, si
amor dicendus copulæ cupido.) The novelty of this
view is evidenced by the mode in which he apologizes
for introducing it. ‘Fateor, paradoxa hæc assertio.’
To Boerhaave, therefore, (especially considering his
great influence as a teacher of chemistry,) we may <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page17">17</a></span> assign the merit of first diffusing a proper view of
Chemical Affinity as a peculiar force, the origin of
almost all chemical changes and operations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-6" href="#fnanchor13-6">13</a></span> <i>Elementa Chemiæ</i>, Lugd. Bat. 1732, p. 677.</div>
<p id="b6c2s3">3. To Boerhaave is usually assigned also the credit
of introducing the <em>word</em> ‘Affinity’ among chemists; but
I do not find that the word is often used by him in
this sense; perhaps not at all<a id="fnanchor14-6" href="#note14-6"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>. But however this may
be, the term is, on many accounts, well worthy to be
preserved, as I shall endeavour to show. Other terms
were used in the same sense during the early part of
the eighteenth century. Thus when Geoffroy, in 1718,
laid before the Academy of Paris his Tables of Affinities, which perhaps did more than any other event to
fix the Idea of Affinity, he termed them ‘Tables of the
Relations of Bodies;’ ‘<i>Tables des Rapports</i>:’ speaking
however, also, of their ‘disposition to unite,’ and using
other phrases of the same import.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-6" href="#fnanchor14-6">14</a></span> See Dumas, <i>Leçons de Phil. Chim.</i>
p. 364. Rees’ <i>Cyclopædia</i>, Art. Chemistry. In the passage of Boerhaave to
which I refer above, <i>affinitas</i> is rather
opposed to, than identified with, chemical combination. When, he says,
the parts of the body to be dissolved
are dissevered by the solvent, why do
they remain united to the particles of
the solvent, and why do not rather
both the particles of the solvent and
of the dissolved body collect into homogeneous bodies by their <i>affinity</i>?
‘denuo se affinitate suæ naturæ colligant in corpora homogenea?‘ And
the answer is, because they possess
another force which counteracts this
affinity of homogeneous particles, and
makes compounds of different elements. Affinity, in chemistry, now
means the tendency of <em>different</em> kinds
of matter to unite: but it appears, as
I have said, to have acquired this
sense since Boerhaave’s time.</div>
<p>The term <i>attraction</i>, having been recommended by
Newton as a fit word to designate the force which produces chemical combination, continued in great favour
in England, where the Newtonian philosophy was
looked upon as applicable to every branch of science.
In France, on the contrary, where Descartes still
reigned triumphant, ‘attraction,’ the watch-word of
the enemy, was a sound never uttered but with dislike
and suspicion. In 1718 (in the notice of Geoffroy’s
Table,) the Secretary of the Academy, after pointing
out some of the peculiar circumstances of chemical <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page18">18</a></span> combinations, says, ‘Sympathies and attractions would
suit well here, if there were such things,’ ‘Les sympathies, les attractions conviendroient bien ici, si elles
étaient quelque chose.’ And at a later period, in
1731, having to write the <i>éloge</i> of Geoffroy after his
death, he says, ‘He gave, in 1718, a singular system,
and a Table of <i>Affinities</i>, or Relations of the different
substances in chemistry. These affinities gave an easiness to some persons, who feared that they were
<em>attractions in disguise</em>, and all the more dangerous in
consequence of the seductive forms which clever people
have contrived to give them. It was found in the
sequel that this scruple might be got over.’</p>
<p>This is the earliest published instance, so far as I am
aware, in which the word ‘Affinity’ is distinctly used
for the cause of chemical composition; and taking into
account the circumstances, the word appears to have
been adopted in France in order to avoid the word
<i>attraction</i>, which had the taint of Newtonianism. Accordingly we find the word <i>affinité</i> employed in the
works of French chemists from this time. Thus, in the
<i>Transactions of the French Academy</i> for 1746, in a
paper of Macquer’s upon Arsenic, he says<a id="fnanchor15-6" href="#note15-6"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>, ‘On peut
facilement rendre raison de ces phenomènes par le
moyen des affinités que les différens substances qui
entrent dans ces combinaisons, ont les uns avec les
autres:’ and he proceeds to explain the facts by reference to Geoffroy’s Table. And in Macquer’s <i>Elements
of Chemistry</i>, which appeared a few years later, the
‘Affinity of Composition’ is treated of as a leading part
of the subject, much in the same way as has been practised in such books up to the present time. From this
period, the word appears to have become familiar to
all European chemists in the sense of which we are
now speaking. Thus, in the year 1758, the Academy
of Sciences at Rouen offered a prize for the best dissertation on Affinity. The prize was shared between
M. Limbourg of Theux, near Liege, and M. Le Sage <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page19">19</a></span> of Geneva<a id="fnanchor16-6" href="#note16-6"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>. About the same time other persons
(Manherr<a id="fnanchor17-6" href="#note17-6"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>, Nicolai<a id="fnanchor18-6" href="#note18-6"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>, and others) wrote on the same
subject, employing the same name.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in 1775, the Swedish chemist Bergman, pursuing still further this subject of Chemical
Affinities, and the expression of them by means of
Tables, returned again to the old Newtonian term;
and designated the disposition of a body to combine
with one rather than another of two others as <i>Elective
Attraction</i>. And as his work on <i>Elective Attractions</i>
had great circulation and great influence, this phrase
has obtained a footing by the side of <i>Affinity</i>, and both
one and the other are now in common use among
chemists.</p>
<p id="b6c2s4">4. I have said above that the term <i>Affinity</i> is
worthy of being retained as a technical term. If we
use the word <i>attraction</i> in this case, we identify or
compare chemical with mechanical attraction; from
which identification and comparison, as I have already
remarked, no one has yet been able to extract the means
of expressing any single scientific truth. If such an
identification or comparison be not intended, the use
of the same word in two different senses can only lead
to confusion; and the proper course, recommended by
all the best analogies of scientific history, is to adopt a
peculiar term for that peculiar relation on which chemical composition depends. The word <i>Affinity</i>, even if
it were not rigorously proper according to its common
meaning, still, being simple, familiar, and well established in this very usage, is much to be preferred
before any other.</p>
<p>But further, there are some analogies drawn from
the common meaning of this word, which appear to
recommend it as suitable for the office which it has to
discharge. For common mechanical attractions and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page20">20</a></span> repulsions, the forces by which one body considered as
a <em>whole</em> acts upon another external to it, are, as we
have said, to be distinguished from those more intimate ties by which the <em>parts</em> of each body are held together. Now this difference is implied, if we compare
the former relations, the attractions and repulsions, to
alliances and wars between States, and the latter, the
internal union of particles, to those bonds of affinity
which connect the citizens of the same state with one
another, and especially to the ties of Family. We have
seen that Boerhaave compares the union of two elements of a compound to their marriage; ‘we must
allow,’ says an eminent chemist of our own time<a id="fnanchor19-6" href="#note19-6"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>,
‘that there is some truth in this poetical comparison.’
It contains this truth,&#8212;that the two become one to
most intents and purposes, and that the Unit thus
formed (the Family) is not a mere juxtaposition of the
component parts. And thus the Idea of Affinity as
the peculiar principle of chemical composition, is established among chemists, and designated by a familiar
and appropriate name.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-6" href="#fnanchor19-6">19</a></span> Dumas, <i>Leçons de Phil. Chim.</i> p. 363.</div>
<p id="b6c2s5">5. <i>Analysis is possible.</i>&#8212;We must, however, endeavour to obtain a further insight into this Idea, thus
fixed and named. We must endeavour to extricate, if
not from the Idea itself, from the processes by which it
has obtained acceptation and currency among chemists,
some principles which may define its application, some
additional specialities in the relations which it implies.
This we shall proceed to do.</p>
<p>The Idea of Affinity, as already explained, implies a
disposition to combine. But this combination is to be
understood as admitting also of a possibility of separation. Synthesis implies Analysis as conceivable: or to
recur to the image which we have already used, Divorce is possible when the Marriage has taken place.</p>
<p>That there is this possibility, is a conviction implied
in all the researches of chemists, ever since the true
notion of composition began to predominate in their
investigations. One of the first persons who clearly <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page21">21</a></span> expressed this conviction was Mayow, an English physician, who published his <i>Medico-Physical Tracts</i> in
1674. The first of them <i>De Sale-Nitro et Spiritu
Nitro-Aerio</i>, contains a clear enunciation of this principle. After showing how, in the combinations of
opposite elements, as acid and alkali, their properties
entirely disappear, and a new substance is formed not
at all resembling either of the ingredients, he adds<a id="fnanchor20-6" href="#note20-6"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>,
‘Although these salts thus mixed appear to be destroyed it is still possible for them to be separated
from each other, with their powers still entire.’ He
proceeds to exemplify this, and illustrates it by the
same image which I have already alluded to:
‘Salia acida a salibus volatilibus discedunt, ut cum
sale fixo tartari, tanquam <i>sponso</i> magis idoneo, <i>conjugium</i> strictius ineunt.’ This idea of a synthesis which
left a complete analysis still possible, was opposed to a
notion previously current, that when two heterogeneous bodies united together and formed a third body,
the two constituents were entirely destroyed, and the
result formed out of their ruins<a id="fnanchor21-6" href="#note21-6"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>. And this conception of Synthesis and Analysis, as processes which
are possible successively and alternately, and each of
which supposes the possibility of the other, has been
the fundamental and regulative principle of the operations and speculations of analytical chemistry from the
time of Mayow to the present day.</p>

<p id="b6c2s6">6. <i>Affinity is Elective.</i>&#8212;When the idea of chemical
affinity, or disposition to unite, was brought into view
by the experiments and reasonings of chemists, they
found it necessary to consider this disposition as <em>elective</em>;&#8212;each element <em>chose</em> one rather than another of
the elements which were presented to it, and quitted
its union with one to unite with another which it preferred. This has already appeared in the passage just
quoted from Mayow. He adds in the same strain, ‘I
have no doubt that fixed salts choose one acid rather
than another, in order that they may coalesce with it <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page22">22</a></span> in a more intimate union.’&#8212;‘Nullus dubito salia fixa
acidum unum præ aliis <em>eligere</em>, ut cum eodem arctiore
unione coalescant.’ The same thought is expressed
and exemplified by other chemists: they notice innumerable cases in which, when an ingredient is combined with a liquid, if a new substance be immersed
which has a greater affinity for the liquid, the liquid
combines with the new substance by election, and the
former <span class="correction" title="emended from ingedient">ingredient</span> is <i>precipitated</i>. Thus Stahl says<a id="fnanchor22-6" href="#note22-6"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>,
‘In spirit of nitre dissolve silver; put in copper and
the silver is thrown down; put in iron and the copper
goes down; put in zinc, the iron precipitates; put in
volatile alkali, the zinc is separated; put in fixed alkali, the volatile quits its hold.’&#8212;As may be seen in
this example, we have in such cases, not only a preference, but a long gradation of preferences. The spirit
of nitre will combine with silver, but it prefers copper;
prefers iron more; zinc still more; volatile alkali yet
more; fixed alkali the most.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-6" href="#fnanchor22-6">22</a></span> <i>Zymotechnia</i>, 1697, p. 117.</div>
<p>The same thing was proved to obtain with regard to
each element; and when this was ascertained, it became the object of chemists to express these degrees of
preference, by lists in which substances were arranged
according to their disposition to unite with another
substance. In this manner was formed Geoffroy’s Table of Affinities (1718), which we have already mentioned. This Table was further improved by other
writers, as Gellert (1751) and Limbourg (1761). Finally Bergman improved these Tables still further,
taking into account not only the order of affinities of
each element for others, but the <em>sum</em> of the tendencies
to unite of each two elements, which sum, he held, determined the resulting combination when several elements were in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="b6c2s7">7. As we have stated in the History<a id="fnanchor23-6" href="#note23-6"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>, when the
doctrine of elective affinities had assumed this very
definite and systematic form, it was assailed by Berthollet, who maintained, in his <i>Essai de Statique</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page23">23</a></span> <i>Chimique</i>, (1803,) that chemical affinities are <em>not</em> elective:&#8212;that, when various elements are brought together, their combinations do not depend upon the kind
of elements alone, but upon the quantity of each which
is present, that which is most abundant always entering most largely into the resulting compounds. It
may seem strange that it should be possible, at so late
a period of the science, to throw doubt upon a doctrine
which had presided over and directed its progress so
long. Proust answered Berthollet, and again maintained that chemical affinity is elective. I have, in
the History, given the judgment of Berzelius upon
this controversy. ‘Berthollet,’ he says, ‘defended
himself with an acuteness which makes the reader
hesitate in his judgment; but the great mass of facts
finally decided the point in favour of Proust.’ I may
here add the opinion pronounced upon this subject by
Dr. Turner<a id="fnanchor24-6" href="#note24-6"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>: ‘Bergman erred in supposing the result of the chemical action to be in every case owing
to elective affinity [for this power is modified in its
effects by various circumstances]: but Berthollet ran
into the opposite extreme in declaring that the effects
formerly ascribed to that power are never produced by
it. That chemical attraction is exerted between different bodies with different degrees of energy, is, I
apprehend, indisputable.’ And he then proceeds to
give many instances of differences in affinity which
cannot be accounted for by the operation of any modifying causes. Still more recently, M. Dumas has taken
a review of this controversy; and, speaking with enthusiasm of the work of Berthollet, as one which had
been of inestimable service to himself in his early study
of chemistry, he appears at first disposed to award to
him the victory in this dispute. But his final verdict
leaves undamaged the general principle now under our
consideration, that chemical affinity is elective. ‘For
my own part,’ he says<a id="fnanchor25-6" href="#note25-6"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>, ‘I willingly admit the notions of Berthollet when we have to do with acids or <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page24">24</a></span> with bases, of which the energy is nearly equal: but
when bodies endued with very energetic affinities are
in presence of other bodies of which the affinities are
very feeble, I propose to adopt the following rule: In
a solution, everything remaining dissolved, the strong
affinities satisfy themselves, leaving the weak affinities
to arrange matters with one another. The strong
acids take the strong bases, and the weak acids can
only unite with the weak bases. The known facts are
perfectly in accordance with this practical rule.’ It is
obvious that this recognition of a distinction between
strong and weak affinities, which operates to such an
extent as to determine entirely the result, is a complete
acknowledgement of the Elective nature of Affinity, as
far as any person acquainted with chemical operations
could contend for it. For it must be allowed by all,
that solubility, and other collateral circumstances, influence the course of chemical combinations, since they
determine whether or not there shall take place that
contact of elements without which affinity cannot possibly operate.</p>

<p id="b6c2s8">8. <i>Affinity is Definite as to quantity.</i>&#8212;In proportion
as chemists obtained a clearer view of the products of
the laboratory as results of the composition of elements,
they saw more and more clearly that these results were
definite; that one element not only preferred to combine with another of a certain kind, but also would
combine with it to a certain extent and no further,
thus giving to the result not an accidental and variable, but a fixed and constant character. Thus salts
being considered as the result of the combination of
two opposite principles, acid and alkali, and being
termed <i>neutral</i> when these principles exactly balanced
each other, Rouelle (who was Royal Professor at Paris
in 1742) admits of neutral salts with excess of acid,
neutral salts with excess of base, and perfect neutral
salts. Beaume maintained<a id="fnanchor26-6" href="#note26-6"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a> against him that there
were no salts except those perfectly neutral, the other
classes being the results of mixture and imperfect <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page25">25</a></span> combination. But this question was not adequately treated
till chemists made every experiment with the balance
in their hands. When this was done, they soon discovered that, in each neutral salt, the proportional
weights of the ingredients which composed it were
always the same. This was ascertained by Wenzel,
whose <i>Doctrine of the Affinities of Bodies</i> appeared in
1777. He not only ascertained that the proportions
of elements in neutral chemical compounds are definite, but also that they are reciprocal; that is, (to
express his results in a manner now employed by chemists), that if <span class="sc">a</span>, a certain weight of a certain acid,
neutralize <i>m</i>, a certain weight of a certain base, and <span class="sc">b</span>,
a certain weight of a certain other acid, neutralize <i>n</i>, a
certain weight of a certain other base; the compound
of <span class="sc">a</span> and <i>n</i> will also be neutral; as also that of <span class="sc">b</span> and <i>m</i>.
The same views were again presented by Richter in
1792, in his <i>Principles of the Measure of Chemical
Elements</i>. And along with these facts, that of the
combination of elements in multiple proportions being
also taken into account, the foundations of the Atomic
Theory were laid; and that Theory was propounded in
1803 by Mr. Dalton. That theory, however, rests
upon the Idea of Substance, as well as upon that Idea
of Chemical Affinity which we are here considering;
and the discussion of its evidence and truth must be
for the present deferred.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-6" href="#fnanchor26-6">26</a></span> Dumas, <i>Phil. Chim.</i> p. 198.</div>
<p id="b6c2s9">9. The two principles just explained,&#8212;that Affinity
is Definite as to the Kind, and as to the Quantity of
the elements which it unites,&#8212;have here been stated as
results of experimental investigation. That they could
never have been clearly understood, and therefore
never firmly established, without laborious and exact
experiments, is certain; but yet we may venture to
say that being once fully known, they may seem to
thoughtful men to possess an evidence beyond that of
mere experiment. For how, in fact, can we conceive
combinations, otherwise than as definite in kind and
quantity? If we were to suppose each element ready
to combine with any other indifferently, and indifferently in any quantity, we should have a world in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page26">26</a></span> which all would be confusion and indefiniteness.
There would be no fixed kinds of bodies. Salts, and
stones, and ores, would approach to and graduate
into each other by insensible degrees. Instead of
this, we know that the world consists of bodies distinguishable from each other by definite differences,
capable of being classified and named, and of having
general propositions asserted concerning them. And
as we cannot conceive a world in which this should
not be the case, it would appear that we cannot conceive a state of things in which the laws of the combination of elements should not be of that definite and
measured kind which we have above asserted.</p>
<p>This will, perhaps, appear more clearly by stating
our fundamental convictions respecting chemical composition in another form, which I shall, therefore, proceed to do.</p>
<p id="b6c2s10">10. <i>Chemical Composition determines Physical Properties.</i>&#8212;However obscure and incomplete may be our
conception of the internal powers by which the ultimate particles of bodies are held together, it involves,
at least, this conviction:&#8212;that these powers are what
determine bodies to be bodies, and therefore contain
the reason of all the properties which, as bodies, they
possess. The forces by which the particles of a body
are held together, also cause it to be hard or soft,
heavy or light, opake or transparent, black or red; for
if these forces are not the cause of these peculiarities,
what can be the cause? By the very supposition
which we make respecting these forces, they include
all the relations by which the parts are combined into
a whole, and therefore they, and they only, must determine all the attributes of the whole. The foundation
of all our speculations respecting the intimate constitution of bodies must be this principle, that their composition determines their properties.</p>
<p>Accordingly we find our chemists reasoning from
this principle with great confidence, even in doubtful
cases. Thus Davy, in his researches concerning the
diamond, says: ‘That some chemical difference must
exist between the hardest and most beautiful of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page27">27</a></span> gems and charcoal, between a non-conductor and a
conductor of electricity, it is scarcely possible to doubt:
and it seems reasonable to expect that a very refined or
perfect chemistry will confirm <i>the analogies of nature</i>;
and show that bodies cannot be the same in their
composition or chemical nature, and yet totally different in their chemical properties.’ It is obvious that
the principle here assumed is so far from being a mere
result of experience, that it is here appealed to to
prove that all previous results of experience on this
subject must be incomplete and inaccurate; and that
there must be some chemical difference between charcoal and diamond, though none had hitherto been detected.</p>
<p id="b6c2s11">11. In what manner, according to what rule, the
chemical composition shall determine the kind of the
substance, we cannot reasonably expect to determine by
mere conjecture or assumption, without a studious examination of natural bodies and artificial compounds.
Yet even in the most recent times, and among men of
science, we find that an assumption of the most arbitrary character has in one case been mixed up with
this indisputable principle, that the elementary composition determines the kind of the substance. In the
classification of minerals, one school of mineralogists
have rightly taken it as their fundamental principle
that the chemical composition shall decide the position
of the mineral in the system. But they have appended
to this principle, arbitrarily and unjustifiably, the
maxim that the element which is <i>largest in quantity</i>
shall fix the class of the substance. To make such an
assumption is to renounce, at once, all hope of framing
a system which shall be governed by the resemblances
of the things classified; for how can we possibly know
beforehand that fifty-five per cent, of iron shall give a
substance its predominant properties, and that forty-five per cent, shall not? Accordingly, the systems of
mineralogical arrangement which have been attempted
in this way, (those of Haüy, Phillips, and others,) have
been found inconsistent with themselves, ambiguous,
and incapable of leading to any general truths. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page28">28</a></span></p>
<p id="b6c2s12">12. <i>Chemical Composition and Crystalline Form correspond.</i>&#8212;Thus the physical properties of bodies depend upon their chemical composition, but in a manner
which a general examination of bodies with reference
to their properties and their composition can alone
determine. We may, however, venture to assert
further, that the more definite the properties are, the
more distinct may we expect to find this dependence.
Now the most definite of the properties of bodies are
those constant properties which involve relations of
space; that is, their figure. We speak not, however,
of that external figure, derived from external circumstances, which, so far from being constant and definite,
is altogether casual and arbitrary; but of that figure
which arises from their internal texture, and which
shows itself not only in the regular forms which they
spontaneously assume, but in the disposition of the
parts to separate in definite directions, and no others.
In short, the most definite of the properties of perfect
chemical compounds is their <i>crystalline structure</i>; and
therefore it is evident that the crystalline structure
of each body, and the forms which it affects, must be
in a most intimate dependence upon its chemical composition.</p>
<p>Here again we are led to the brink of another
theory;&#8212;that of crystalline structure, which has excited great interest among philosophers ever since
the time of Haüy. But this theory involves, besides
that idea of chemical composition with which we are
here concerned, other conceptions, which enter into
the relations of figure. These conceptions, governed
principally by the Idea of Symmetry, must be unfolded
and examined before we can venture to discuss any
theory of crystallization: and we shall proceed to do
this as soon as we have first duly considered the Idea
of Substance and its consequences.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page29"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Idea of Substance.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b6c3s1">1. <i>Axiom of the Indestructibility of Substance.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">We</span>
now come to an Idea of which the history is very different from those of which we have lately been speaking. Instead of being gradually and recently brought
into a clear light, as has been the case with the Ideas
of Polarity and Affinity, the Idea of Substance has
been entertained in a distinct form from the first periods
of European speculation. That this is so, is proved
by our finding a principle depending upon this Idea
current as an axiom among the early philosophers of
Greece:&#8212;namely, that <em>nothing can be produced out of
nothing</em>. Such an axiom, more fully stated, amounts
to this: that the substance of which a body consists is
incapable of being diminished (and consequently incapable of being augmented) in quantity, whatever apparent changes it may undergo. Its forms, its distribution, its qualities, may vary, but the substance itself is
identically the same under all these variations.</p>
<p>The axiom just spoken of was the great principle
of the physical philosophy of the Epicurean school, as
it must be of every merely material philosophy. The
reader of Lucretius will recollect the emphasis with
which it is repeatedly asserted in his poem:</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i2">E nilo nil gigni, in nilum nil posse reverti;</span><br/>
    <span class="i0">Nought comes of nought, nor ought returns to nought.</span><br/>
   </div>
</div></div>
<p>Those who engaged in these early attempts at physical speculation were naturally much pleased with the
clearness which was given to their notions of change,
composition, and decomposition, by keeping steadily
hold of the Idea of Substance, as marked by this <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page30">30</a></span> fundamental axiom. Nor has its authority ever ceased
to be acknowledged. A philosopher was asked<a id="fnanchor27-6" href="#note27-6"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>, What
is the weight of smoke? He answered, ‘Subtract the
weight of the ashes from the weight of the wood which
is burnt, and you have the weight of the smoke.’ This
reply would be assented to by all; and it assumes as
incontestable that even under the action of fire, the
material, the substance, does not perish, but only
changes its form.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-6" href="#fnanchor27-6">27</a></span> Kant, <i>Kritik der R. V.</i> p. 167.</div>
<p>This principle of the indestructibility of substance
might easily be traced in many reasonings and researches, ancient and modern. For instance, when
the chemist works with the <i>retort</i>, he places the body
on which he operates in one part of an inclosed cavity,
which, by its bendings and communications, separates
at the same time that it confines, the products which
result from the action of fire: and he assumes that this
process is an analysis of the body into its ingredients,
not a creation of anything which did not exist before,
or a destruction of anything which previously existed.
And he assumes further, that the total quantity of the
substance thus analysed is the sum of the quantities
of its ingredients. This principle is the very basis of
chemical speculation, as we shall hereafter explain
more fully.</p>
<p id="b6c3s2">2. <i>The Idea of Substance.</i>&#8212;The axiom above spoken
of depends upon the Idea of Substance, which is involved in all our views of external objects. We unavoidably assume that the qualities and properties
which we observe are properties of <em>things</em>;&#8212;that the
adjective implies a substantive;&#8212;that there is, besides
the external characters of things, something <em>of which</em>
they are the characters. An apple which is red, and
round, and hard, is not merely redness, and roundness,
and hardness: these circumstances may all alter while
the apple remains the same apple. Behind or under the
appearances which we see, we conceive something of
which we think; or, to use the metaphor which obtained currency among the ancient philosophers, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page31">31</a></span> attributes and qualities which we observe are supported by and inherent in something: and this something is hence called a <i>substratum</i> or <i>substance</i>,&#8212;that
which stands <i>beneath</i> the apparent qualities and supports them.</p>
<p>That we have such an <i>Idea</i>, using the term ‘Idea’
in the sense in which I have employed it throughout
these disquisitions, is evident from what has been
already said. The Axiom of the Indestructibility of
Substance proves the existence of the Idea of Substance, just as the Axioms of Geometry and Arithmetic prove the existence of the Ideas of Space and
Number. In the case of Substance, as of space or
number, the ideas cannot be said to be borrowed from
experience, for the axioms have an authority of a far
more comprehensive and demonstrative character than
any which experience can bestow. The axiom that
nothing can be produced from nothing and nothing
destroyed, is so far from being a result of experience,
that it is apparently contradicted by the most obvious
observation. It has, at first, the air of a paradox; and
by those who refer to it, it is familiarly employed to
show how fallacious common observation is. The
assertion is usually made in this form;&#8212;that nothing
is created and nothing annihilated, <em>notwithstanding</em>
that the common course of our experience appears to
show the contrary. The principle is not an empirical,
but a necessary and universal truth;&#8212;is collected, not
from the evidence of our senses, but from the operation
of our ideas. And thus the universal and undisputed
authority of the axiom proves the existence of the Idea
of Substance.</p>
<p id="b6c3s3">3. <i>Locke’s Denial of the Idea of Substance.</i>&#8212;I shall
not attempt to review the various opinions which have
been promulgated respecting this Idea: but it may be
worth our while to notice briefly the part which it
played in the great controversy concerning the origin
of our ideas which Locke’s <i>Essay</i> occasioned. Locke’s
object was to disprove the existence of all ideas not
derived from Sensation or Reflection: and since the
idea of substance as distinct from external qualities, is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page32">32</a></span> manifestly not derived directly from sensation, nor by
any very obvious or distinct process from reflection,
Locke was disposed to exclude the idea as much as
possible. Accordingly, in his argumentation against
Innate Ideas<a id="fnanchor28-6" href="#note28-6"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a>, he says plainly, ‘the idea of substance,
which we neither have nor can have by sensation or
reflection.’ And the inference which he draws is,
‘that we have no such clear idea at all.’ What then,
it may be asked, do we mean by the word <i>substance</i>?
This also he answers, though somewhat strangely, ‘We
signify nothing by the word <i>substance</i>, but only an uncertain supposition of we know not what, <i>i. e.</i> of something whereof we have no particular distinct positive
idea, which we take to be the substratum, or support,
of those ideas we know.’ That while he indulged in
this tautological assertion of our ignorance and uncertainty, he should still have been compelled to acknowledge that the word substance had some meaning, and
should have been driven to explain it by the identical
metaphors of ‘substratum’ and ‘support,’ is a curious
proof how impossible it is entirely to reject this idea.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-6" href="#fnanchor28-6">28</a></span> <i>Essay</i>, b. i. c. iv. s. 18.</div>
<p>But as we have already seen, the supposition of the
existence of substance is so far from being uncertain,
that it carries with it irresistible conviction, and substance is necessarily conceived as something which
cannot be produced or destroyed. It may be easily
supposed, therefore, that when the controversy between
Locke and his assailants came to this point, he would
be in some difficulty. And, indeed, though with his
accustomed skill in controversy, he managed to retain
a triumphant tone, he was driven from his main points.
Thus he repels the charge that he took the being of
substance to be doubtful<a id="fnanchor29-6" href="#note29-6"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a>. He says, ‘Having everywhere affirmed and built upon it that man is a substance, I cannot be supposed to question or doubt of
the being of substance, till I can question or doubt of
my own being.’ He attempts to make a stand by saying that <em>being</em> of things does not depend upon our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page33">33</a></span> <em>ideas</em>; but if he had been asked how, without having
an <em>idea</em> of substance, he <em>knew</em> substance to <em>be</em>, it is
difficult to conceive what answer he could have made.
Again, he had said that our idea of substance arises
from our ‘accustoming ourselves to suppose’ a substratum of qualities. Upon this his adversary, Bishop
Stillingfleet, very properly asks, Is this custom grounded upon true reason or no? To which Locke replies,
that it is grounded upon this: That we cannot conceive how simple ideas of sensible qualities should subsist alone; and therefore we suppose them to exist in,
and to be supported by some common subject, which
support we denote by the name substance. Thus he
allows, not only that we necessarily assume the reality
of substance, but that we cannot conceive qualities
without substance; which are concessions so ample as
almost to include all that any advocate for the Idea of
Substance need desire.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-6" href="#fnanchor29-6">29</a></span> <i>Essay</i>, b. ii. c. ii. and <i>First Letter to the Bishop of Worcester</i>.</div>
<p>Perhaps Locke, and the adherents of Locke, in
denying that we have an idea of substance in general,
were latently influenced by finding that they could
not, by any effort of mind, call up any <em>image</em> which
could be considered as an image of substance in general. That in this sense we have no idea of substance,
is plain enough; but in the same sense we have no
idea of space in general, or of time, or number, or
cause, or resemblance. Yet we certainly have such a
power of representing to our minds space, time, number, cause, resemblance, as to arrive at numerous
truths by means of such representations. These general representations I have all along called Ideas, nor
can I discover any more appropriate word; and in this
sense, we have also, as has now been shown, an Idea
of Substance.</p>
<p id="b6c3s4">4. <i>Is all Material Substance heavy?</i>&#8212;The principle that the quantity of the substance of any body
remains unchanged by our operations upon it, is, as
we have said, of universal validity. But then the
question occurs, how are we to ascertain the quantity
of substance, and thus, to apply the principle in particular cases. In the case above mentioned, where <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page34">34</a></span> smoke was to be weighed, it was manifestly assumed
that the quantity of the substance might be known by
its weight; and that the total quantity being unchanged, the total weight also would remain the same.
Now on what grounds do we make this assumption?
Is all material substance heavy? and if we can assert
this to be so, on what grounds does the truth of the
assertion rest? These are not idle questions of barren
curiosity; for in the history of that science (Chemistry)
to which the Idea of Substance is principally applicable,
nothing less than the fate of a comprehensive and long
established theory (the Phlogiston theory) depended
upon the decision of this question. When it was urged
that the reduction of a metal from a calcined to a
metallic form could not consist in the <em>addition</em> of phlogiston, because the metal was lighter than the calx had
been; it was replied by some, that this was not conclusive, for that phlogiston was a principle of levity,
diminishing the weight of the body to which it was
added. This reply was, however, rejected by all the
sounder philosophers, and the force of the argument
finally acknowledged. But why was this suggestion of
a substance having no weight, or having absolute
levity, repudiated by the most reflective reasoners?
It is assumed, it appears, that all matter must be
heavy; what is the ground of this assumption?</p>
<p>The ground of such an assumption appears to be
the following. Our idea of substance includes in it
this:&#8212;that substance is a quantity capable of addition;
and thus capable of making up, by composition, a sum
equal to all its parts. But substance, and the quantity of substance, can be known to us only by its attributes and qualities. And the qualities which are
capable constantly and indefinitely of increase and
diminution by increase and diminution of the parts,
must be conceived inseparable from the substance.
For the qualities, if removable from the substance at
all, must be removable by some operation performed
upon the substance; and by the idea of substance, all
such operations are only equivalent to separation, junction, and union of parts. Hence those characters <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page35">35</a></span> which thus universally increase and diminish by addition and subtraction of the things themselves, belong
to the substance of the things. They are measures
of its quantity, and are not merely its separable qualities.</p>
<p>The weight of bodies is such a character. However
we compound or divide bodies, we compound and
divide their weight in the same manner. We may dismember a body into the minutest parts; but the sum
of the weights of the parts is always equal to the
whole weight of the body. The weight of a body can
be in no way increased or diminished, except by adding something to it or taking something from it. If
we bake a brick, we do not conceive that the change
of colour or of hardness, implies that anything has
been created or destroyed. It may easily be that the
parts have only assumed a new arrangement; but if
the brick have lost weight, we suppose that something
(moisture for instance) has been removed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thus weight is apprehended as essential to matter.
In considering the dismemberment or analysis of
bodies, we assume that there must be some criterion
of the quantity of substance; and this criterion can
possess no other properties than their weight possesses.
If we assume an element which has no weight, or the
weight of which is negative, as some of the defenders
of phlogiston attempted to do, we put an end to all
speculation on such subjects. For if weight is not
the criterion of the quantity of one element, phlogiston
for instance, why is weight the criterion of the quantity
of any other element? We may, by the same right,
assume any other real or imaginary element to have
levity instead of gravity; or to have a peculiar intensity of gravity which makes its weight no index of its
quantity. In short, if we do this, we deprive of all
possibility of application our notions of element, analysis, and composition; and violate the postulates on
which the questions are propounded which we thus
attempt to decide.</p>
<p>We must, then, take a constant and quantitative
property of matter, such as weight is, to be an index <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page36">36</a></span> of the quantity of matter or of substance to which it
belongs. I do not here speak of the question which
has sometimes been proposed, whether the <em>weight</em> or
the <em>inertia</em> of bodies be the more proper measure of
the quantity of matter. For the measure of inertia is
regulated by the same assumption as that of substance:&#8212;that the quantity of the whole must be equal
to the quantity of all the parts: and inertia is measured by weight, for the same reason that substance
is so.</p>
<p>Having thus established the certainty, and ascertained the interpretation of the fundamental principle
which the Idea of Substance involves, we are prepared
to consider its application in the science upon which it
has a peculiar bearing.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p>[3rd Ed.]&#8212;[<span class="sc">The</span> doctrine here propounded, that All
Matter is Heavy, has been opposed by Sir William
Hamilton of Edinburgh. (<i>Works of Reid</i>, note, p. 853.)
This writer is a man of unquestionable acuteness and
of very extensive reading; but his acuteness shows
itself in barren ontological distinctions, which appear
to me to be of the same character as the speculations
of the eminent Schoolmen of the most sterile periods of
the dark ages. That he should have no conception of
progressive or inductive science is not wonderful, when
we recollect that he holds, as an important part of his
philosophy, that the study of mathematics perverts and
obscures the mind. But it may be of some interest to
consider his objections to the doctrine here maintained.</p>
<p>He says, 1st, that our reasoning assumes that we
must necessarily have it in our power to ascertain the
Quantity of Matter; whereas this may be a problem
out of the reach of human determination.</p>
<p>To this I reply, that my reasoning <em>does</em> assume that
there is a science, or sciences, which make assertions
concerning the Quantity of Matter: Mechanics and
Chemistry are such sciences. My assertion is, that to
make such sciences possible, Quantity of Matter must
be proportional to Weight. If my opponent deny that
Mechanics and Chemistry can exist as sciences, he may
invalidate my proof; but not otherwise.</p>
<p>2. He says that there are two conceivable ways of
estimating the Quantity of Matter: by the Space occupied, and by the Weight or Inertia; and that I assume
the second measure gratuitously.</p>
<p>To which I reply, that the most elementary steps in
Mechanics and in Chemistry contradict the notion that <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page38">38</a></span> the Quantity of Matter is proportionate to the Space.
They proceed necessarily on a distinction between
Space and Matter:&#8212;between mere Extension and material Substance.</p>
<p>3. He allows that we cannot make the Extension of
a body the measure of the Quantity of Matter, because,
he says, we do not know if ‘the compressing force’ is
such as to produce ‘the closest compression.’ That is,
he assumes a compressing force, assumes a closest compression, assumes a peculiar (and very improbable)
atomic hypothesis; and all this to supply a reason why
we are not to believe the first simple principle of
Mechanics and Chemistry.</p>
<p>4. He speaks of ‘a series of apparent fluids (as Light
or its vehicle, the Calorific, the Electro-galvanic, and
Magnetic agents) which we can neither denude of their
character of substance, nor clothe with the attribute of
weight.’</p>
<p>To which my reply is, that precisely because I cannot
‘clothe’ these agents with the attribute of Weight, I
<em>do</em> ‘denude them of the character of Substance.’ They
are not substances, but agencies. These Imponderable
Agents are not properly called ‘Imponderable Fluids.’
This I conceive that I have proved; and the proof is
not shaken by denying the conclusion without showing
any defect in the reasoning.</p>
<p>5. Finally, my critic speaks about ‘a logical canon,’
and about ‘a criterion of truth, subjectively necessary
and objectively certain;’ which matters I shall not
waste the reader’s time by discussing.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Application of the Idea of Substance in Chemistry.</span></h3>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
</div>
<p id="b6c4s1">1. <i>A Body is Equal to the Sum of its Elements.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">From</span> the earliest periods of chemistry the balance has
been familiarly used to determine the proportions of
the ingredients and of the compound; and soon after
the middle of the last century, this practice was so
studiously followed, that Wenzel and Richter were
thereby led to the doctrine of Definite Proportions.
But yet the full value and significance of the balance,
as an indispensable instrument in chemical researches,
was not understood till the gaseous, as well as solid
and fluid ingredients were taken into the account.
When this was done, it was found that the principle,
that the whole is equal to the sum of its parts, of
which, as we have seen, the necessary truth, in such
cases, flows from the idea of substance, could be applied
in the most rigorous manner. And conversely, it was
found that by the use of the balance, the chemist
could decide, in doubtful cases, which was a whole, and
which were parts.</p>
<p>For chemistry considers all the changes which belong
to her province as compositions and decompositions of
elements; but still the question may occur, whether an
observed change be the one or the other. How can we
distinguish whether the process which we contemplate
be composition or decomposition?&#8212;whether the new
body be formed by addition of a new, or subtraction of
an old element? Again; in the case of decomposition,
we may inquire, What are the ultimate limits of our
analysis? If we decompound bodies into others more
and more simple, how far can we carry this succession <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page40">40</a></span> of processes? How far can we proceed in the road of
analysis? And in our actual course, what evidence
have we that our progress, as far as it has gone, has
carried us from the more complex to the more simple?</p>
<p>To this we reply, that the criterion which enables
us to distinguish, decidedly and finally, whether our
process have been a mere analysis of the proposed body
into its ingredients, or a synthesis of some of them with
some new element, is the principle stated above, that
the weight of the whole is equal to the weight of
all the parts. And no process of chemical analysis or
synthesis can be considered complete till it has been
verified by this fact;&#8212;by finding that the weight of the
compound is the weight of its supposed ingredients; or,
that if there be an element which we think we have
detached from the whole, its loss is betrayed by a corresponding diminution of weight.</p>
<p>I have already noticed what an important part this
principle has played in the great chemical controversy
which ended in the establishment of the oxygen theory.
The calcination of a metal was decided to be the union
of oxygen with the metal, and not the separation of
phlogiston from it, because it was found that in the process of calcination, the weight of the metal increased,
and increased exactly as much as the weight of ambient
air diminished. When oxygen and hydrogen were exploded together, and a small quantity of water was
produced, it was held that this was really a synthesis
of water, because, when very great care was taken
with the process, the weight of the water which resulted
was equal to the weight of the gases which disappeared.</p>
<p id="b6c4s2">2. <i>Lavoisier.</i>&#8212;It was when gases came to be considered as entering largely into the composition of
liquid and solid bodies, that extreme accuracy in weighing was seen to be so necessary to the true understanding of chemical processes. It was in this manner
discovered by Lavoisier and his contemporaries that
oxygen constitutes a large ingredient of calcined metals,
of acids, and of water. A countryman of Lavoisier<a id="fnanchor30-6" href="#note30-6"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page41">41</a></span> has not only given most just praise to that great philosopher for having constantly tested all his processes
by a careful and skilful use of the balance, but has also
claimed for him the merit of having introduced the
maxim, that in chemical operations nothing is created
and nothing lost. But I think it is impossible to
deny that this maxim is assumed in all the attempts at
analysis made by his contemporaries, as well as by him.
This maxim is indeed included in any clear notion of
analysis: it could not be the result of the researches of
any one chemist, but was the governing principle of
the reasonings of all. Lavoisier, however, employed
this principle with peculiar assiduity and skill. In
applying it, he does not confine himself to mere additions and subtractions of the quantities of ingredients;
but often obtains his results by more complex processes. In one of his investigations he says, ‘I may
consider the ingredients which are brought together,
and the result which is obtained as an algebraical equation; and if I successively suppose each of the quantities of this equation to be unknown, I can obtain its
value from the rest: and thus I can rectify the experiment by the calculation, and the calculation by the experiment. I have often taken advantage of this
method, in order to correct the first results of my experiments, and to direct me in repeating them with
proper precautions.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-6" href="#fnanchor30-6">30</a></span> M. Dumas, <i>Leçons de la Philosophie Chimique</i>. 1837. p. 157.</div>
<p>The maxim, that the whole is equal to the sum of
all its parts, is thus capable of most important and
varied employment in chemistry. But it may be applied in another form to the exclusion of a class of
speculations which are often put forwards.</p>
<p id="b6c4s3">3. <i>Maxim respecting Imponderable Elements.</i>&#8212;Several of the phenomena which belong to bodies, as
heat, light, electricity, magnetism, have been explained
hypothetically by assuming the existence of certain
fluids; but these fluids have never been shown to have
weight. Hence such hypothetical fluids have been
termed <i>imponderable elements</i>. It is however plain,
that so long as these fluids appear to be without
weight, they are not <em>elements</em> of bodies in the same <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page42">42</a></span> sense as those elements of which we have hitherto
been speaking. Indeed we may with good reason
doubt whether those phenomena depend upon transferable fluids at all. We have seen strong reason to
believe that light is not matter, but only motion; and
the same thing appears to be probable with regard to
heat. Nor is it at all inconceivable that a similar
hypothesis respecting electricity and magnetism should
hereafter be found tenable. Now if heat, light, and
those other agents, be not matter, they are not <em>elements</em> in such a sense as to be included in the principle referred to above, That the body is equal to the
sum of its elements. Consequently the maxim just
stated, that in chemical operations nothing is created,
nothing annihilated, does not apply to Light and Heat.
They are not <em>things</em>. And whether heat can be produced where there was no heat before, and light struck
out from darkness, the ideas of which we are at present treating do not enable us to say. In reasoning
respecting chemical synthesis and analysis therefore,
we shall only make confusion by attempting to include
in our conception the Light and Heat which are produced and destroyed. Such phenomena may be very
proper subjects of study, as indeed they undoubtedly
are; but they cannot be studied to advantage by considering them as sharing the nature of composition
and decomposition.</p>
<p>Again: in all attempts to explain the processes of
nature, the proper course is, first to measure the facts
with precision, and then to endeavour to understand
their cause. Now the facts of chemical composition
and decomposition, the weights of the ingredients and
of the compounds, are facts measurable with the utmost precision and certainty. But it is far otherwise
with the light and heat which accompany chemical
processes. When combustion, deflagration, explosion,
takes place, how can we measure the light or the heat?
Even in cases of more tranquil action, though we can
apply the thermometer, what does the thermometer
tell us respecting the <em>quantity</em> of the heat? Since
then we have no measure which is of any value as <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page43">43</a></span> regards such circumstances in chemical changes, if we
attempt to account for these phenomena <em>on chemical
principles</em>, we introduce, into investigations in themselves perfectly precise and mathematically rigorous,
another class of reasonings, vague and insecure, of
which the only possible effect is to vitiate the whole
reasoning, and to make our conclusions inevitably
erroneous.</p>
<p>We are led then to this maxim: that <i>imponderable
fluids are</i> not <i>to be admitted as chemical elements of
bodies</i><a id="fnanchor31-6" href="#note31-6"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note31-6" href="#fnanchor31-6">31</a></span> See the <a href="#v2page37">answer</a> to Sir William Hamilton’s objections, at the end of the last chapter.<br/>
&#8195;Since we are thus warned by a sound view of the nature of science, from considering chemical affinity as having any hold upon imponderable elements, we are manifestly still more decisively prohibited from supposing mechanical impulse or pressure to have any effect upon such elements. To make this supposition, is to connect the most subtle and incorporeal objects which we know in nature by the most gross material ties. This remark seems to be applicable to M. Poisson’s hypothesis that the electric fluid is retained at the surface of bodies by the pressure of the atmosphere.</div>
<p id="b6c4s4">4. It appears, I think, that our best and most philosophical chemists have proceeded upon this principle
in their investigations. In reasoning concerning the
constitution of bodies and the interpretation of chemical changes, the attempts to include in these interpretations the heat or cold produced, by the addition
or subtraction of a certain hypothetical ‘caloric,’ have
become more and more rare among men of science.
Such statements, and the explanations often put forwards of the light and heat which appear under various
circumstances in the form of fire, must be considered
as unessential parts of any sound theory. Accordingly
we find Mr. Faraday gradually relinquishing such
views. In January, 1834, he speaks generally of an
hypothesis of this kind<a id="fnanchor32-6" href="#note32-6"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a>: ‘I cannot refrain from
recalling here the beautiful idea put forth, I believe
by Berzelius, in his development of his views of the
electro-chemical theory of affinity, that the heat and
light evolved during cases of powerful combination <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page44">44</a></span> are the consequence of the electric discharge which is
at that moment taking place.’ But in April of the
same year<a id="fnanchor33-6" href="#note33-6"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a>, he observes, that in the combination of
oxygen and hydrogen to produce water, electric powers
to a most enormous amount are for the time active,
but that the flame which is produced gives but feeble
traces of such powers. ‘Such phenomena,’ therefore,
he adds, ‘may not, cannot, be taken as evidences of the
nature of the action; but are merely incidental results,
incomparably small in relation to the forces concerned,
and supplying no information of the way in which
the particles are active on each other, or in which
their forces are finally arranged.’</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-6" href="#fnanchor33-6">33</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, 960.</div>
<p>In pursuance of this maxim, we must consider as
an unessential part of the oxygen theory that portion
of it, much insisted upon by its author at the time,
in which when sulphur, for instance, combined with
oxygen to produce sulphuric acid, the combustion was
accounted for by means of the <em>caloric</em> which was
supposed to be <em>liberated</em> from its combination with
oxygen.</p>
<p id="b6c4s5">5. <i>Controversy of the Composition of Water.</i>&#8212;There
is another controversy of our times to which we may
with great propriety apply the maxim now before us.
After the glory of having first given a true view of
the composition of water had long rested tranquilly
upon the names of Cavendish and Lavoisier, a claim
was made in favour of James Watt as the real author
of this discovery by his son, (Mr J. Watt,) and his
eulogist, (M. Arago<a id="fnanchor34-6" href="#note34-6"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a>). It is not to our purpose here
to discuss the various questions which have arisen on
this subject respecting priority of publication, and
respecting the translation of opinions published at one
time into the language of another period. But if we
look at Watt’s own statement of his views, given soon
after those of Cavendish had been published, we shall
perceive that it is marked by a violation of this maxim:
we shall find that he does admit imponderable fluids <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page45">45</a></span> as chemical elements; and thus shows a vagueness and
confusion in his idea of chemical composition. With
such imperfection in his views, it is not surprising
that Watt, not only did not anticipate, but did not
apprehend quite precisely the discovery of Cavendish
and Lavoisier. Watt’s statement of his views is as
follows<a id="fnanchor35-6" href="#note35-6"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a>:&#8212;‘Are we not authorized to conclude that
water is composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston deprived of part of their latent or elementary
heat; that dephlogisticated or pure air is composed of
water deprived of its phlogiston and united to elementary heat and light; and that the latter are contained in it in a latent state, so as not to be sensible
to the thermometer or to the eye; and if light be only
a modification of heat, or a circumstance attending it,
or a component part of the inflammable air, then pure
or dephlogisticated air is composed of water deprived
of its phlogiston and united to elementary heat?’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-6" href="#fnanchor34-6">34</a></span> Éloge de James Watt, <i>Annuaire du Bur. des Long.</i> 1839.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-6" href="#fnanchor35-6">35</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1784, p. 332.</div>
<p>When we compare this doubtful and hypothetical
statement, involving so much that is extraneous and
heterogeneous, with the conclusion of Cavendish, in
which there is nothing hypothetical or superfluous, we
may confidently assent to the decision which has been
pronounced by one<a id="fnanchor36-6" href="#note36-6"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a> of our own time in favour of
Cavendish. And we may with pleasure recognize, in
this enlightened umpire, a due appreciation of the
value of the maxim on which we are now insisting.
‘Cavendish,’ says Mr. Vernon Harcourt, ‘pared off <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page46">46</a></span> from the hypotheses their theories of combustion, and
<em>affinities of imponderable for ponderable matter</em>, as
complicating chemical with physical considerations.’</p>

has been published by Mr. Muirhead.
I do not find, in this publication, any
reason for withdrawing what I have
stated in the text above: but with
reference to the statement in the
<i>History</i>, it appears that Mr. Cavendish’s claim to the discovery was not
uncontested in his own time. Mr.
Watt had looked at the composition
of water, as a problem to be solved,
perhaps more distinctly than Mr. Cavendish had done; and he conceived
himself wronged by Mr. Cavendish’s
putting forwards his experiment as
the first solution of this problem.</div>
<p id="b6c4s6">6. <i>Relation of Heat to Chemistry.</i>&#8212;But while we
thus condemn the attempts to explain the thermotical
phenomena of chemical processes by means of chemical
considerations, it may be asked if we are altogether
to renounce the hope of understanding such phenomena? It is plain, it may be said, that heat generated
in chemical changes is always a very important circumstance, and can sometimes be measured, and perhaps reduced to laws; are we prohibited from speculating concerning the causes of such circumstances
and such laws? And to this we reply, that we may
properly attempt to connect chemical with thermotical
processes, <em>so far as</em> we have obtained a clear and
probable view of the nature of the thermotical processes. When our theory of Thermotics is tolerably
complete and certain, we may with propriety undertake to connect it with our theory of Chemistry. But
at present we are not far enough advanced in our
knowledge of heat to make this attempt with any
hope of success. We can hardly expect to understand
the part which heat plays in the union of two bodies,
when we cannot as yet comprehend in what manner it
produces the liquefaction or vaporization of one body.
We cannot look to account for Gay Lussac and Dalton’s
Law, that all gases expand equally by heat, till we
learn how heat causes a gas to expand. We cannot
hope to see the grounds of Dulong and Petit’s Law,
that the specific heat of all atoms is the same, till we
know much more, not only about atoms, but about
specific heat. We have as yet no thermotical theory
which even professes to account for all the prominent
facts of the subject<a id="fnanchor37-6" href="#note37-6"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a>: and the theories which have
been proposed are of the most diverse kind. Laplace
assumes particles of bodies surrounded by atmospheres
of caloric<a id="fnanchor38-6" href="#note38-6"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a>; Cauchy makes heat consist in longitudinal
vibrations of the ether of which transverse vibrations <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page47">47</a></span> produce light: in Ampère’s theory<a id="fnanchor39-6" href="#note39-6"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a>, heat consists in
the vibrations of the particles of bodies. And so long
as we have nothing more certain in our conceptions of
heat than the alternative of these and other precarious
hypotheses, how can we expect to arrive at any real
knowledge, by connecting the results of such hypotheses with the speculations of Chemistry, of which science
the theory is at least equally obscure?</p>

<p>The largest attempts at chemical theory have been
made in the form of the Atomic Theory, to which I
have just had occasion to allude. I must, therefore,
before quitting the subject, say a few words respecting
this theory.</p>
<div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">The Atomic Theory.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b6c5s1">1. <i>The Atomic Theory considered on Chemical
Grounds.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">We</span> have already seen that the combinations which result from chemical affinity are definite, a
certain quantity of one ingredient uniting, not with
an uncertain, but with a certain quantity of another
ingredient. But it was found, in addition to this principle, that one ingredient would often unite with
another in different proportions, and that, in such
cases, these proportions are multiples one of another.
In the three salts formed by potassa with oxalic acid,
the quantities of acid which combine with the same
quantity of alkali are exactly in the proportion of the
numbers 1, 2, 4. And the same rule of the existence of multiple proportions is found to obtain in other
cases.</p>
<p>It is obvious that such results will be accounted for,
if we suppose that the base and the acid consist each of
numerous definite equal particles, and that the formation of the salts above mentioned consists in the combination of one particle of the base with one particle of
acid, with two particles of acid, and with four particles
of acid, respectively. But further; as we have already
stated, chemical affinity is not only definite, but reciprocal. The proportions of potassa and soda which form
neutral salts being 590 and 391 in one case, they are so
in all cases. These numbers represent <em>proportions</em> of
weight in which the two bases, potassa and soda, enter
into analogous combinations; 590 of potassa is <em>equivalent</em> to 391 of soda. These facts with regard to combination are still expressed by the above supposition
of equal particles, assuming that the weights of a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page49">49</a></span> particle of potassa and of soda are in the proportion
of 590 to 391.</p>
<p>But we pursue our analysis further. We find that
potassa is a compound of a metallic base, potassium,
and of oxygen, in the proportion of 490 to 100; we
suppose, then, that the particle of potassa consists of
a particle of potassium and a particle of oxygen; and
these latter particles, since we see no present need to
suppose them divided, potassium and oxygen being
simple bodies, we may call <i>atoms</i>, and assume to be
indivisible. And by supposing all simple bodies to
consist of such atoms, and compounds to be formed by
the union of two, or three, or more of such atoms, we
explain the occurrence of definite and multiple proportions, and we construct the Atomic Theory.</p>
<p id="b6c5s2">2. <i>Hypothesis of Atoms.</i>&#8212;So far as the assumption
of such atoms as we have spoken of serves to express
those laws of chemical composition which we have
referred to, it is a clear and useful generalization. But
if the Atomic Theory be put forwards (and its author,
Dr. Dalton, appears to have put it forwards with such
an intention,) as asserting that chemical elements are
really composed of <em>atoms</em>, that is, of such particles not
further divisible, we cannot avoid remarking, that for
such a conclusion, chemical research has not afforded,
nor can afford, any satisfactory evidence whatever.
The smallest observable quantities of ingredients, as
well as the largest, combine according to the laws of
proportions and equivalence which have been cited
above. How are we to deduce from such facts any
inference with regard to the existence of certain smallest possible particles? The Theory, when dogmatically taught as a physical truth, asserts that all observable quantities of elements <em>are</em> composed of proportional numbers of particles which can no further
be subdivided; but all which observation teaches us is,
that if there be such particles, they are smaller than
the smallest observable quantities. In chemical experiment, at least, there is not the slightest positive
evidence for the existence of such atoms. The assumption of <em>indivisible</em> particles, smaller than the smallest <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page50">50</a></span> observable, which combine, particle with particle, will
explain the phenomena; but the assumption of particles bearing this proportion, but <em>not</em> possessing the
property of indivisibility, will explain the phenomena
at least equally well. The decision of the question,
therefore, whether the Atomic Hypothesis be the proper way of conceiving the chemical combinations of
substances, must depend, not upon chemical facts, but
upon our conception of Substance. In this sense the
question is an ancient and curious controversy, and
we shall hereafter have to make some remarks upon it.</p>
<p id="b6c5s3">3. <i>Chemical Difficulties of the Hypothesis.</i>&#8212;But
before doing this, we may observe that there is no
small difficulty in reconciling this hypothesis with the
facts of chemistry. According to the theory, all salts,
compounded of an acid and a base, are analogous in
their atomic constitution; and the number of atoms in
one such compound being known or assumed, the
number of atoms in other salts may be determined.
But when we proceed in this course of reasoning to
other bodies, as metals, we find ourselves involved in
difficulties. The protoxide of iron is a base which,
according to all analogy, must consist of one atom of
iron and one of oxygen: but the peroxide of iron is
also a base, and it appears by the analysis of this substance that it must consist of <i>two-thirds</i> of an atom of
iron and one atom of oxygen. Here, then, our indivisible atoms must be divisible, even upon chemical
grounds. And if we attempt to evade this difficulty
by making the peroxide of iron consist of two atoms of
iron and three of oxygen, we have to make a corresponding alteration in the theoretical constitution of
all bodies analogous to the protoxide; and thus we
overturn the very foundation of the theory. Chemical
facts, therefore, not only do not prove the Atomic
Theory as a physical truth, but they are not, according
to any modification yet devised of the theory, reconcileable with its scheme.</p>
<p>Nearly the same conclusions result from the attempts to employ the Atomic Hypothesis in expressing another important chemical law;&#8212;the law of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page51">51</a></span> combinations of gases according to definite proportions
of their volumes, experimentally established by Gay
Lussac<a id="fnanchor40-6" href="#note40-6"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a>. In order to account for this law, it has been
very plausibly suggested that all gases, under the same
pressure, contain an equal number of atoms in the
same space; and that when they combine, they unite
atom to atom. Thus one volume of chlorine unites
with one volume of hydrogen, and forms hydrochloric
acid<a id="fnanchor41-6" href="#note41-6"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a>. But then this hydrochloric acid occupies the
space of the two volumes; and therefore the proper
number of particles cannot be supplied, and the uniform distribution of atoms in all gases maintained,
without dividing into two each of the compound particles, constituted of an atom of chlorine and an atom of
hydrogen. And thus in this case, also, the Atomic
Theory becomes untenable if it be understood to imply
the indivisibility of the atoms.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-6" href="#fnanchor41-6">41</a></span> Dumas, <i>Phil. Chim.</i> 263.</div>
<p>In all these attempts to obtain distinct physical
conception of chemical union by the aid of the Atomic
Hypothesis, the atoms are conceived to be associated by
certain forces of the nature of mechanical attractions.
But we have already seen<a id="fnanchor42-6" href="#note42-6"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> that no such mode of conception can at all explain or express the facts of chemical combination; and therefore it is not wonderful
that when the Atomic Theory attempts to give an
account of chemical relations by contemplating them
under such an aspect, the facts on which it grounds
itself should be found not to authorize its positive doctrines; and that when these doctrines are tried upon
the general range of chemical observation, they should
prove incapable of even expressing, without self-contradiction, the laws of phenomena.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-6" href="#fnanchor42-6">42</a></span> See <a href="#b6c1s1">Chapter I</a>. of this book.</div>
<p id="b6c5s4">4. <i>Grounds of the Atomic Doctrine.</i>&#8212;Yet the doctrine of atoms, or of substance as composed of indivisible particles, has in all ages had great hold upon the
minds of physical speculators; nor would this doctrine ever have suggested itself so readily, or have
been maintained so tenaciously, as the true mode of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page52">52</a></span> conceiving chemical combinations, if it had not been
already familiar to the minds of those who endeavour
to obtain a general view of the constitution of nature.
The grounds of the assumption of the atomic structure
of substance are to be found rather in the idea of
substance itself, than in the experimental laws of chemical affinity. And the question of the existence of
atoms, thus depending upon an idea which has been
the subject of contemplation from the very infancy of
philosophy, has been discussed in all ages with interest
and ingenuity. On this very account it is unlikely that
the question, so far as it bears upon chemistry, should
admit of any clear and final solution. Still it will be
instructive to look back at some of the opinions which
have been delivered respecting this doctrine.</p>
<p id="b6c5s5">5. <i>Ancient Prevalence of the Atomic Doctrine.</i>&#8212;The
doctrine that matter consists of minute, simple, indivisible, indestructible particles as its ultimate elements,
has been current in all ages and countries, whenever
the tendency of man to wide and subtle speculations
has been active. I need not attempt to trace the history of this opinion in the schools of Greece and Italy.
It was the leading feature in the physical tenets of
the Epicureans, and was adopted by their Roman disciples, as the poem of Lucretius copiously shows us.
The same tenet had been held at still earlier periods,
in forms more or less definite, by other philosophers.
It is ascribed to Democritus, and is said to have been by
him derived from Leucippus. But this doctrine is found
also, we are told<a id="fnanchor43-6" href="#note43-6"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a>, among the speculations of another
intellectual and acute race, the Hindoos. According
to some of their philosophical writers, the ultimate
elements of matter are atoms, of which it is proved by
certain reasonings, that they are each one-sixth of one
of the motes that float in the sunbeam.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-6" href="#fnanchor43-6">43</a></span> By Mr. Colebrook. <i>Asiatic Res.</i> 1824.</div>
<p>This early prevalence of controversies of the widest
and deepest kind, which even in our day remain undecided, has in it nothing which need surprize us; or, at
least, it has in it nothing which is not in conformity <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page53">53</a></span> with the general course of the history of philosophy.
As soon as any ideas are clearly possessed by the
human mind, its activity and acuteness in reasoning
upon them are such, that the fundamental antitheses
and ultimate difficulties which belong to them are soon
brought into view. The Greek and Indian philosophers had mastered completely the Idea of Space, and
possessed the Idea of Substance in tolerable distinctness. They were, therefore, quite ready, with their
lively and subtle minds, to discuss the question of the
finite and infinite divisibility of matter, so far as it involved only the ideas of space and of substance, and
this accordingly they did with great ingenuity and perseverance.</p>
<p>But the ideas of Space and of Substance are far from
being sufficient to enable men to form a complete general view of the constitution of matter. We must add
to these ideas, that of mechanical Force with its antagonist Resistance, and that of the Affinity of one kind
of matter for another. Now the former of these ideas
the ancients possessed in a very obscure and confused
manner; and of the latter they had no apprehension
whatever. They made vague assumptions respecting
the impact and pressure of atoms on each other; but
of their mutual attraction and repulsion they never
had any conception, except of the most dim and
wavering kind; and of an affinity different from mere
local union they did not even dream. Their speculations concerning atoms, therefore, can have no value
for us, except as a part of the history of science. If
their doctrines appear to us to approach near to the
conclusions of our modern philosophy, it must be because our modern philosophy is that philosophy which
has not fully profited by the additional light which
the experiments and meditations of later times have
thrown upon the constitution of matter.</p>
<p id="b6c5s6">6. <i>Bacon.</i>&#8212;Still, when modern philosophers look
upon the Atomic Theory of the ancients in a general
point of view merely, without considering the special
conditions which such a theory must fulfil, in order to
represent the discoveries of modern times, they are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page54">54</a></span> disposed to regard it with admiration. Accordingly
we find Francis Bacon strongly expressing such a feeling. The Atomic Theory is selected and dwelt upon
by him as the chain which connects the best parts of
the physical philosophy of the ancient and the modern
world. Among his works is a remarkable dissertation
<i>On the Philosophy of Democritus, Parmenides, and
Telesius</i>: the last mentioned of whom was one of the
revivers of physical science in modern times. In this
work he speaks of the atomic doctrine of Democritus
as a favourable example of the exertions of the undisciplined intellect. ‘Hæc ipsa placita, quamvis paulo
emendatiora, talia sunt qualia esse possunt illa quæ ab
intellectu sibi permisso, nec continenter et gradatim
sublevato, profecta videntur.’&#8212;‘These doctrines, thus
[in an ancient fable] presented in a better form, are
such glimpses of truth as can be obtained by the intellect left to its own natural impulses, and not
ascending by successive and connected steps,’ [as the
Baconian philosophy directs]. ‘Accordingly,’ he adds,
‘the doctrine of Atoms, from its going a step beyond
the period in which it was advanced, was ridiculed by
the vulgar, and severely handled in the disputations of
the learned, notwithstanding the profound acquaintance with physical science by which its author was
allowed to be distinguished, and from which he acquired the character of a magician.’</p>
<p>‘However,’ he continues, ‘neither the hostility of
Aristotle, with all his skill and vigour in disputation,
(though, like the Ottoman sultans, he laboured to
destroy all his brother philosophers that he might rest
undisputed master of the throne of science,) nor the
majestic and lofty authority of Plato, could effect the
subversion of the doctrine of Democritus. And while
the opinions of Plato and Aristotle were rehearsed
with loud declamation and professorial pomp in the
schools, this of Democritus was always held in high
honour by those of a deeper wisdom, who followed in
silence a severer path of contemplation. In the days
of Roman speculation it kept its ground and its favour;
Cicero everywhere speaks of its author with the  <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page55">55</a></span> greatest praise; and Juvenal, who, like poets in general,
probably expressed the prevailing judgment of his
time, proclaims his merit as a noble exception to the
general stupidity of his countrymen.</p>

<p>‘The destruction of this philosophy was not effected
by Aristotle and Plato, but by Genseric and Attila,
and their barbarians. For then, when human knowledge had suffered shipwreck, those fragments of the
Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy floated on the
surface like things of some lighter and emptier sort,
and so were preserved; while more solid matters went
to the bottom, and were almost lost in oblivion.’</p>
<p id="b6c5s7">7. <i>Modern Prevalence of the Atomic Doctrine.</i>&#8212;It
is our business here to consider the doctrine of Atoms
only in its bearing upon existing physical sciences,
and I must therefore abstain from tracing the various
manifestations of it in the schemes of hypothetical
cosmologists;&#8212;its place among the <i>vortices</i> of Descartes,
its exhibition in the <i>monads</i> of Leibnitz. I will, however, quote a passage from Newton to show the hold
it had upon his mind.</p>
<p>At the close of his <i>Opticks</i> he says, ‘All these things
being considered, it seems probable to me that God,
in the beginning, formed matter in solid, massy, hard,
impenetrable, moveable particles, of such sizes and
figures, and with such other properties, and in such
proportions to space, as most conduced to the end for
which He formed them; and that the primitive particles, being solids, are incomparably harder than any
porous bodies compounded of them, even so very hard
as never to wear or break in pieces; no ordinary power
being able to divide what God had made one in the
first creation. While the particles continue entire,
they may compose bodies of one and the same nature
and texture in all ages: but should they wear away or
break in pieces, the nature of things depending on
them would be changed. Water and earth composed <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page56">56</a></span> of old worn particles and fragments of particles would
not be of the same nature and texture now with water
and earth composed of entire particles in the beginning. And therefore that nature may be lasting, the
changes of corporeal things are to be placed only in
the various separations and new associations and motions of these permanent particles; compounded bodies
being apt to break, not in the midst of solid particles,
but where those particles are laid together and only
touch in a few points.’</p>
<p>We shall <a href="#b6c5s10">hereafter</a> see how extensively the atomic
doctrine has prevailed among still more recent philosophers. Not only have the chemists assumed it as the
fittest form for exhibiting the principles of multiple
proportions; but the physical mathematicians, as Laplace and Poisson, have made it the basis of their
theories of heat, electricity, capillary action; and the
crystallographers have been supposed to have established both the existence and the arrangement of
such ultimate molecules.</p>
<p>In the way in which it has been employed by such
writers, the hypothesis of ultimate particles has been
of great use, and is undoubtedly permissible. But
when we would assert this theory, not as a convenient
hypothesis for the expression or calculation of the
laws of nature, but as a philosophical truth respecting
the constitution of the universe, we find ourselves
checked by difficulties of reasoning which we cannot
overcome, as well as by conflicting phenomena which
we cannot reconcile. I will attempt to state briefly
the opposing arguments on this question.</p>
<p id="b6c5s8">8. <i>Arguments for and against Atoms.</i>&#8212;The leading
arguments on the two sides of the question, in their
most general form, may be stated as follows:</p>
<p><i>For</i> the Atomic Doctrine.&#8212;The appearances which
nature presents are compounded of many parts, but if
we go on resolving the larger parts into smaller, and
so on successively, we must at last come to something
simple. For that which is compound can be so no
otherwise than by composition of what is simple; and
if we suppose all composition to be removed, which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page57">57</a></span> hypothetically we may do, there can remain nothing
but a number of simple substances, capable of composition, but themselves not compounded. That is, matter
being dissolved, resolves itself into atoms.</p>
<p><i>Against</i> the Atomic Doctrine.&#8212;Space is divisible
without limit, as may be proved by Geometry; and
matter occupies space, therefore matter is divisible
without limit, and no portion of matter is indivisible,
or an <i>atom</i>.</p>
<p>And to the argument on the other side just stated,
it is replied that we cannot even hypothetically divest
a body of composition, if by composition we mean the
relation of point to point in space. However small be
a particle, it is compounded of parts having relation in
space.</p>
<p>The Atomists urge again, that if matter be infinitely
divisible, a finite body consists of an infinite number of
parts, which is a contradiction. To this it is replied,
that the finite body consists of an infinite number of
parts in the same sense in which the parts are infinitely small, which is no contradiction.</p>
<p>But the opponents of the Atomists not only rebut,
but retort this argument drawn from the notion of
infinity. Your atoms, they say, are indivisible by any
finite force; therefore they are infinitely hard; and
thus your finite particles possess infinite properties.
To this the Atomists are wont to reply, that they do
not mean the hardness of their particles to be infinite,
but only so great as to resist all usual natural forces.
But here it is plain that their position becomes untenable; for, in the first place, their assumption of this
precise degree of hardness in the particles is altogether
gratuitous; and in the next place, if it were granted,
such particles are not atoms, since in the next moment
the forces of nature may be augmented so as to divide
the particle, though hitherto undivided.</p>
<p>Such are the arguments for and against the Atomic
Theory in its original form. But when these atoms
are conceived, as they have been by Newton, and commonly by his followers, to be solid, hard particles
exerting attractive and repulsive forces, a new set of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page58">58</a></span> arguments come into play. Of these, the principal
one may be thus stated: According to the Atomic
Theory thus modified, the properties of bodies depend
upon the attractions and repulsions of the particles.
Therefore, among other properties of bodies, their hardness depends upon such forces. But if the hardness <em>of
the bodies</em> depends upon the forces, the repulsion, for
instance, of the particles, upon what does the hardness
<em>of the particles</em> depend? what progress do we make in
explaining the properties of bodies, when we assume
the same properties in our explanation? and to what
purpose do we assume that the particles are hard?</p>
<p id="b6c5s9">9. <i>Transition to Boscovich’s Theory.</i>&#8212;To this difficulty it does not appear easy to offer any reply. But
if the hardness and solidity of the particles be given
up as an incongruous and untenable appendage to the
Newtonian view of the Atomic Theory, we are led to
the theory of Boscovich, according to which matter
consists not of solid particles, but of mere mathematical
centers of force. According to this theory, each body
is composed of a number of geometrical points from
which emanate forces, following certain mathematical
laws in virtue of which the forces become, at certain
small distances attractive, at certain other distances
repulsive, and at greater distances attractive again.
From these forces of the points arise the cohesion of
the parts of the same body, the resistance which it
exerts against the pressure of another body, and finally
the attraction of gravitation which it exerts upon bodies
at a distance.</p>
<p>This theory is at least a homogeneous and consistent
theory, and it is probable that it may be used as an
instrument for investigating and expressing true laws
of nature; although, as we have already said, the
attempt to identify the forces by which the particles
of bodies are bound together with mechanical attraction, appears to be a confusion of two separate ideas<a id="fnanchor44-6" href="#note44-6"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-6" href="#fnanchor44-6">44</a></span> ‘Boscovich’s Theory,’ that all bodies may be considered as consisting of a mere collection of centers of forces, may be so conceived as possibly to involve an explanation of all the powers which their parts exert, (such powers, namely, as those which
produce optical, thermotical and chemical phenomena;) but this theory
cannot supply an explanation of the
mechanical properties of a body as a
whole, especially of its <em>inertia</em>. A collection of mere centers of force can
have no inertia. If two bodies are considered as two collections of centers of
force, the one attracting the other, there is in this view nothing to limit or determine the velocity with which the
one body will approach the other.
A world composed of such bodies is
not a <em>material</em> world: for matter (as
we have already seen in book iii.
<a href="#b3c5s1">chapter v.</a>) implies not only force,
but something which resists the action of force.</div>
<p id="b6c5s10"><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page59">59</a></span> 10. <i>Use of the Molecular Hypothesis.</i>&#8212;In this form,
representing matter as a collection of molecules or
centers of force, the Atomic Theory has been abundantly employed in modern times as an hypothesis on
which calculations respecting the elementary forces of
bodies might be conducted. When thus employed it is
to be considered as expressing the principle that the
properties of bodies depend upon forces emanating
from immovable points of their mass. This view of
the way in which the properties of bodies are to be
treated by the mechanical philosopher was introduced
by Newton, and was a natural sequel to the success
which he had obtained by reasoning concerning central
forces on a large scale. I have already quoted his
Preface to the <i>Principia</i>, in which he says, ‘Many
things induce me to believe that the rest of the phenomena of nature, as well as those of astronomy, may
depend upon certain forces by which the particles of
bodies, in virtue of causes not yet known, are urged
towards each other and cohere in regular figures, or
are mutually repelled and recede; and philosophers,
knowing nothing of these forces, have hitherto failed
in their examination of nature.’ Since the time of
Newton, this line of speculation has been followed
with great assiduity, and by some mathematicians
with great success. In particular Laplace has shown
that the hypothesis may, in many instances, be made
a much closer representation of nature, if we suppose the forces exerted by the particles to decrease so
rapidly with the increasing distance from them, that <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page60">60</a></span> the force is finite only at distances imperceptible to
our senses, and vanishes at all remoter points. He has
taught the method of expressing and calculating such
forces, and he and other mathematicians of his school
have applied this method to many of the most important questions of physics; as capillary action, the elasticity of solids, the conduction and radiation of heat.
The explanation of many apparently unconnected and
curious observed facts by these mathematical theories
gives a strong assurance that its essential principles
are true. But it must be observed that the actual
constitution of bodies as composed of distinct and
separate particles is by no means proved by these
coincidences. The assumption, in the reasoning, of
certain centers of force acting at a distance, is to be
considered as nothing more than a method of reducing
to calculation that view of the constitution of bodies
which supposes that they exert force at <em>every</em> point.
It is a mathematical artifice of the same kind as the
hypothetical division of a body into infinitesimal
parts, in order to find its center of gravity; and no
more implies a physical reality than that hypothesis
does.</p>
<p id="b6c5s11">11. <i>Poisson’s Inference.</i>&#8212;When, therefore, M. Poisson, in his views of Capillary Action, treats this hypothetical distribution of centers of force as if it were
a physical fact, and blames Laplace for not taking
account of their different distribution at the surface of
the fluid and below it<a id="fnanchor45-6" href="#note45-6"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a>, he appears to push the claims
of the molecular hypothesis too far. The only ground
for the assumption of separate centers, is that we can
thus explain the action of the whole mass. The intervals between the centers nowhere enter into this
explanation: and therefore we can have no reason for
assuming these intervals different in one part of the
fluid and in the other. M. Poisson asserts that the
density of the fluid diminishes when we approach very
near the surface; but he allows that this diminution is
not detected by experiment, and that the formulæ on <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page61">61</a></span> his supposition, so far as the results go, are identical
with those of Laplace. It is clear, then, that his doctrine consists merely in the assertion of the necessary
truth of a part of the hypothesis which cannot be put
to the test of experiment. It is true, that so long as
we have before us the hypothesis of separate centers,
the particles very near the surface are not in a condition symmetrical with that of the others: but it is
also true that this hypothesis is only a step of calculation. There results, at one period of the process of
deduction, a stratum of smaller density at the surface
of the fluid; but at a succeeding point of the reasoning
the thickness of this stratum vanishes; it has no physical existence.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-6" href="#fnanchor45-6">45</a></span> Poisson, <i>Théorie de l’Action Capillaire</i>.</div>
<p>Thus the <i>molecular</i> hypothesis, as used in such
cases, does not differ from the doctrine of forces acting
at <em>every point</em> of the mass; and this principle, which
is common to both the opposite views, is the true part
of each.</p>
<p id="b6c5s12">12. <i>Wollaston’s Argument.</i>&#8212;An attempt has been
made in another case, but depending on nearly the
same arguments, to bring the doctrine of ultimate
atoms to the test of observation. In the case of the
air, we know that there <em>is</em> a diminution of density in
approaching the upper surface of the atmosphere, if it
have a surface: but it is held by some that except we
allow the doctrine of ultimate molecules, it will not
be bounded by any surface, but will extend to an infinite distance. This is the reasoning of Wollaston<a id="fnanchor46-6" href="#note46-6"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a>.
‘If air consists of any ultimate particles no longer
divisible, then must the expansion of the medium
composed of them cease at that distance where the
force of gravity downwards is equal to the resistance
arising from the repulsive force of the medium.’ But
if there be no such ultimate particles, every stratum
will require a stratum beyond it to prevent by its
weight a further expansion, and thus the atmosphere <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page62">62</a></span> must extend to an infinite distance. And Wollaston
conceived that he could learn from observation whether
the atmosphere was thus diffused through all space;
for if so, it must, he argued, be accumulated about the
larger bodies of the system, as Jupiter and the Sun,
by the law of universal gravitation; and the existence
of an atmosphere about these bodies, might, he remarked, be detected by its effects in producing refraction. His result is, that ‘all the phenomena accord
entirely with the supposition that the earth’s atmosphere is of finite extent, limited by the weight of
ultimate atoms of definite magnitude, no longer divisible by repulsion of their parts.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-6" href="#fnanchor46-6">46</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1822, p. 89.</div>
<p>A very little reflection will show us that such a line
of reasoning cannot lead to any result. For we know
nothing of the law which connects the density with
the compressing force, in air so extremely rare as we
must suppose it to be near the boundary of the atmosphere. Now there are possible laws of dependence
of the density upon the compressing force such that
the atmosphere would terminate in virtue of the law
without any assumption of atoms. This may be proved
by mathematical reasoning. If we suppose the density
of air to be as the square root of the compressing
force, it will follow that at the very limits of the atmosphere, the strata of equal thickness may observe in
their densities such a law of proportion as is expressed
by the numbers 7, 5, 3, 1<a id="fnanchor47-6" href="#note47-6"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-6" href="#fnanchor47-6">47</a></span> For the compressing force on
each being as the whole weight beyond it, it will be for the four highest
strata, 16, 9, 4 and 1, of which the
square roots are as 4, 3, 2, 1, or, as
8, 6, 4, 2; and though these numbers
are not exactly as the densities
7, 5, 3, 1, those who are a little
acquainted with mathematical reasoning, will see that the difference
arises from taking so small a number
of strata. If we were to make the
strata indefinitely thin, as to avoid
error we ought to do, the coincidence
would be exact; and thus, according
to this law, the series of strata terminates as we ascend, without any
consideration of atoms.</div>
<p>If it be asked how, on this hypothesis, the density
of the highest stratum can be as 1, since there is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page63">63</a></span> nothing to compress it, we answer that the upper part of
the highest stratum compresses the lower, and that the
density diminishes continually to the surface, so that
the need of compression and the compressing weight
vanish together.</p>
<p>The fallacy of concluding that because the height
of the atmosphere is finite, the weight of the highest
stratum must be finite, is just the same as the fallacy
of those who conclude that when we project a body
vertically upwards, because it occupies only a finite
time in ascending to the highest point, the velocity at
the last instant of the ascent must be finite. For it
might be said, if the last velocity of ascent be not
finite, how can the body describe the last particle of
space in a finite time? and the answer is, that there is
no last finite particle of space, and therefore no last
finite velocity.</p>
<p id="b6c5s13">13. <i>Permanence of Properties of Bodies.</i>&#8212;We have
already seen that, in explaining the properties of matter as we find them in nature, the assumption of solid,
hard, indestructible particles is of no use or value.
But we may remark, before quitting the subject, that
Newton appears to have had another reason for assuming such particles, and one well worthy of notice. He
wished to express, by means of this hypothesis, the
doctrine that the laws of nature do not alter with the
course of time. This we have already seen in the
quotation from Newton. ‘The ultimate particles of
matter are indestructible, unalterable, impenetrable;
for if they could break or wear, the structure of material bodies now would be different from that which
it was when the particles were new.’ No philosopher
will deny the truth which is thus conveyed by the
assertion of atoms; but it is obviously equally easy
for a person who rejects the atomic view, to state this
truth by saying that the forces which matter exerts
do not vary with time, but however modified by the
new modifications of its form, are always unimpaired
in quantity, and capable of being restored to their
former mode of action. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page64">64</a></span></p>
<p>We now proceed to speculations in which the fundamental conceptions may, perhaps, be expressed, at
least in some cases, by means of the arrangement of
atoms; but in which the philosophy of the subject
appears to require a reference to a new Fundamental
Idea.</p>

<span class="sc">Explication of the Idea of Symmetry.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b7c1s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>E
have seen in the History of the Sciences,
that the principle which I have there termed<a id="fnanchor1-7" href="#note1-7"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>
the Principle of Developed and Metamorphosed Symmetry, has been extensively applied in botany and physiology, and has given rise to a province of science
termed Morphology. In order to understand clearly
this principle, it is necessary to obtain a clear idea of
the Symmetry of which we thus speak. But this Idea
of Symmetry is applicable in the inorganic, as well as
in the organic kingdoms of nature; it is presented to
our eyes in the forms of minerals, as well as of flowers
and animals; we must, therefore, take it under our
consideration here, in order that we may complete our
view of Mineralogy, which, as I have repeatedly said,
is an essential part of Chemical science. I shall accordingly endeavour to unfold the Idea of Symmetry with
which we here have to do.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-7" href="#fnanchor1-7">1</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xvii. c. vi.</div>
<p>It will of course be understood that by the term
<i>Symmetry</i> I here intend, not that more indefinite attribute of form which belongs to the domain of the fine
arts, as when we speak of the ‘symmetry’ of an edifice <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page68">68</a></span> or of a sculptured figure, but a certain definite relation
or property, no less rigorous and precise than other
relations of number and position, which is thus one of
the sure guides of the scientific faculty, and one of the
bases of our exact science.</p>
<p id="b7c1s2">2. In order to explain what Symmetry is in this
sense, let the reader recollect that the bodies of animals
consist of <em>two</em> equal and similar sets of members, the
right and the left side;&#8212;that some flowers consist of
three or of five equal sets of organs, similarly and regularly disposed, as the iris has <em>three</em> straight petals,
and three reflexed ones, alternately disposed, the rose
has <em>five</em> equal and similar sepals of the calyx, and alternate with these, as many petals of the corolla. This
orderly and exactly similar distribution of two, or three,
or five, or any other number of parts, is Symmetry; and
according to its various modifications, the forms thus
determined are said to be <i>symmetrical</i> with various
numbers of members. The classification of these different kinds of symmetry has been most attended to in
Crystallography, in which science it is the highest and
most general principle by which the classes of forms
are governed. Without entering far into the technicalities of the subject, we may point out some of the
features of such classes.</p>
<p><img src="images/w1.jpg" alt="crystals with triangular symmetry" style="float:left;" />The first of the figures
(1) in the margin may
represent the summit of
a crystal as it appears to
an eye looking directly
down upon it; the center
of the figure represents
the summit of a pyramid, and the spaces of various
forms which diverge from this point represent sloping
sides of the pyramid. Now it will be observed that
the figure consists of three portions exactly similar to
one another, and that each part or member is repeated
in each of these portions. The faces, or pairs of faces,
are repeated in <i>threes</i>, with exactly similar forms and
angles. This figure is said to be <i>three-membered</i>, or to
have <i>triangular</i> symmetry. The same kind of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page69">69</a></span> symmetry may exist in a flower, as presented in the accompanying figure, and does, in fact, occur in a large class
of flowers, as for example, all the lily tribe. <img src="images/w2.jpg" alt="crystals with other symmetries" style="padding-left:1em; float:right;" />The next
pair of figures (2) have four equal and similar portions,
and have their members
or pairs of members four
times repeated. Such
figures are termed <i>four-membered</i>, and are said
to have <i>square</i> or <i>tetragonal</i> symmetry. The
<i>pentagonal</i> symmetry,
formed by <i>five</i> similar
<i>members</i>, is represented
in the next figures (3).
It occurs abundantly in
the vegetable world, but
never among crystals;
for the pentagonal figures which crystals
sometimes assume, are
never exactly regular.
But there is still another kind of symmetry
(4) in which the opposite ends are exactly
similar to each other
and also the opposite
sides; this is <i>oblong</i>, or
<i>two-and-two-membered</i>
symmetry. And finally,
we have the case of <i>simple</i> symmetry (5) in
which the two sides of
the object are exactly
alike (in opposite positions) without any further repetition.</p>
<p id="b7c1s3">3. These different kinds of symmetry occur in
various ways in the animal, vegetable, and mineral
kingdom. Vertebrate animals have a right and a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page70">70</a></span> left side exactly alike, and thus possess <i>simple</i> symmetry. The same kind of symmetry (simple symmetry)
occurs very largely in the forms of vegetables, as in
most leaves, in <i>papilionaceous</i>, <i>personate</i>, and <i>labiate</i>
flowers. Among minerals, crystals which possess this
symmetry are called <i>oblique-prismatic</i>, and are of very
frequent occurrence. The <i>oblong</i>, or <i>two-and-two-membered</i> symmetry belongs to <i>right-prismatic</i> crystals; and
may be seen in <i>cruciferous</i> flowers, for though these
are cross-shaped, the cross has two longer and two
shorter arms, or pairs of arms. The <i>square</i> or <i>tetragonal</i> symmetry occurs in crystals abundantly; to the
vegetable world it appears to be less congenial; for
though there are flowers with four exactly similar
and regularly-disposed petals, as the herb Paris (<i>Paris
quadrifolia</i>), these flowers appear, from various circumstances, to be deviations from the usual type of vegetable forms. The <i>trigonal</i>, or <i>three-membered</i> symmetry
is found abundantly both in plants and in crystals,
while the <i>pentagonal</i> symmetry, on the other hand,
though by far the most common among flowers,
nowhere occurs in minerals, and does not appear to be
a possible form of crystals. This pentagonal form
further occurs in the animal kingdom, which the
oblong, triangular, and square forms do not. Many
of Cuvier’s <i>radiate</i> animals appear in this pentagonal
form, as <i>echini</i> and <i>pentacrinites</i>, which latter have
hence their name.</p>
<p id="b7c1s4">4. The regular, or as they may be called, the <i>normal</i>
types of the vegetable world appear to be the forms
which possess triangular and pentagonal symmetry;
from these the others may be conceived to be derived,
by transformations resulting from the expansion of one
or more parts. Thus it is manifest that if in a three-membered or five-membered flower, one of the petals
be expanded more than the other, it is immediately
reduced from pentagonal or trigonal, to simple symmetry. And the oblong or two-and-two-membered
symmetry of the flowers of cruciferous plants, (in which
the stamens are four large and two small ones, arranged
in regular opposition,) is held by botanists to result <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page71">71</a></span> from a normal form with ten stamens; Meinecke explaining this by adhesion, and Sprengel by the metamorphosis of the stamens into petals<a id="fnanchor2-7" href="#note2-7"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-7" href="#fnanchor2-7">2</a></span> Sprengel, <i>Gesch. d. Bot.</i> ii. 304.</div>
<p>It is easy to see that these various kinds of symmetry include relations both of form and of number,
but more especially of the latter kind; and as this
symmetry is often an important character in various
classes of natural objects, such classes have often
curious numerical properties. One of the most remarkable and extensive of these is the distinction
which prevails between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants; the number <i>three</i> being the ground of
the symmetry of the former, and the number <i>five</i>, of
the latter. Thus liliaceous and bulbous plants, and the
like, have flowers of three or six petals, and the other
organs follow the same numbers: while the vast majority of plants are pentandrous, and with their five
stamens have also their other parts in fives. This great
numerical distinction corresponding to a leading difference of physiological structure cannot but be considered
as a highly curious fact in phytology. Such properties
of numbers, thus connected in an incomprehensible
manner with fundamental and extensive laws of nature,
give to numbers an appearance of mysterious importance and efficacy. We learn from history how strongly
the study of such properties, as they are exhibited by
the phenomena of the heavens, took possession of the
mind of Kepler; perhaps it was this which, at an
earlier period, contributed in no small degree to the
numerical mysticism of the Pythagoreans in antiquity,
and of the Arabians and others in the middle ages. In
crystallography, numbers are the primary characters
in which the properties of substances are expressed;&#8212;they appear, first, in that classification of forms which
depends on the degree of symmetry, that is, upon the
number of correspondencies; and next, in the laws of
derivation, which, for the most part, appear to be common in their occurrence in proportion to the numerical
simplicity of their expression. But the manifestation <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page72">72</a></span> of a governing numerical relation in the organic world
strikes us as more unexpected; and the selection
of the number <i>five</i> as the index of the symmetry of
dicotyledonous plants and radiated animals, (a number
which is nowhere symmetrically produced in inorganic
bodies,) makes this a new and remarkable illustration
of the constancy of numerical relations. We may observe, however, that the moment one of these radiate
animals has one of its five members expanded, or in
any way peculiarly modified, (as happens among the
echini), it is reduced to the common type of animals
simply symmetrical, with a right and left side.</p>
<p id="b7c1s5">5. It is not necessary to attempt to enumerate all
the kinds of Symmetry, since our object is only to explain what Symmetry is, and for this purpose enough
has probably been said already. It will be seen, as
soon as the notion of Symmetry in general is well apprehended, that it is or includes a peculiar Fundamental Idea, not capable of being resolved into any of
the ideas hitherto examined. It may be said, perhaps,
that the Idea of Symmetry is a modification or derivative of our ideas of space and number;&#8212;that a symmetrical shape is one which consists of parts exactly
similar, repeated a certain number of times, and placed
so as to correspond with each other. But on further
reflection it will be seen that this repetition and correspondence of parts in symmetrical figures are something peculiar; for it is not <em>any</em> repetition or any
correspondence of parts to which we should give the
name of symmetry, in the manner in which we are
now using the term. Symmetrical arrangements may,
no doubt, be concerned with space and position, time
and number; but there appears to be implied in them
a Fundamental Idea of regularity, of completeness, of
complex simplicity, which is not a mere modification of
other ideas.</p>
<p id="b7c1s6">6. It is, however, not necessary, in this and in
similar cases, to determine whether the idea which we
have before us be a peculiar and independent Fundamental Idea or a modification of other ideas, provided
we clearly perceive the evidence of those Axioms by <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page73">73</a></span> means of which the Idea is applied in scientific reasonings. Now in the application of the Idea of Symmetry
to crystallography, phytology and zoology, we must
have this idea embodied in some principle which asserts
more than a mere geometrical or numerical accordance
of members. We must have it involved in some vital
or productive action, in order that it may connect and
explain the facts of the organic world. Nor is it difficult to enunciate such a principle. We may state it
in this manner. <em>All the symmetrical members of a
natural product are, under like circumstances, alike
affected by the natural formative power.</em> The parts
which we have termed <i>symmetrical</i>, resemble each
other, not only in their form and position, but also in
the manner in which they are produced and modified
by natural causes. And this principle we assume to
be necessarily true, however unknown and inconceivable may be the causes which determine the phenomena. Thus it has not yet been found possible to discover or represent to ourselves, in any intelligible
manner, the forces by which the various faces of a
crystal are consequent upon its primary form: for the
hypothesis of their being built up of integrant molecules, as Haüy held, cannot be made satisfactory. But
though the mechanism of crystals is still obscure, there
is no doubt as to the principle which regulates their
modifications. The whole of crystallography rests upon
this principle, that if one of the primary planes or axes
be modified in any manner, all the symmetrical planes
and axes must be modified in the same manner. And
though accidental mechanical or other causes may interfere with the actual exhibition of such faces, we do not
the less assume their crystallographical reality, as inevitably implied in the law of symmetry of the crystal<a id="fnanchor3-7" href="#note3-7"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>.
And we apply similar considerations to organized beings.
We assume that in a regular flower, each of the similar <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page74">74</a></span> members has the same organization and similar powers
of developement; and hence if among these similar parts
some are much less developed than others, we consider
them as <i>abortive</i>; and if we wish to remove doubts as
to what are symmetrical members in such a case, we
make the inquiry by tracing the anatomy of these
members, or by following them in their earlier states
of developement, or in cases where their capabilities are
magnified by monstrosity or otherwise. The power of
developement may be modified by external causes, and
thus we may pass from one kind of symmetry to another; as we have already remarked. Thus a regular
flower with pentagonal symmetry, growing on a lateral
branch, has one petal nearest to the axis of the plant:
if this petal be more or less expanded than the others,
the pentagonal symmetry is interfered with, and the
flower may change to a symmetry of another kind.
But it is easy to see that all such conceptions of expansion, abortion, and any other kind of metamorphosis, go
upon the supposition of identical faculties and tendencies in each similar member, in so far as such tendencies have any relation to the symmetry. And thus the
principle we have stated above is the basis of that
which, in the History, we termed the Principle of
Developed and Metamorphosed Symmetry.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-7" href="#fnanchor3-7">3</a></span> Some crystalline forms, instead
of being <i>holohedral</i> (provided with
their whole number of faces), are
<i>hemihedral</i> (provided with only half
their number of faces). But in these
hemihedral forms the half of the
faces are still <i>symmetrically</i> suppressed.</div>
<p>We shall not at present pursue the other applications of this Idea of Symmetry, but we shall consider
some of the results of its introduction into Crystallography.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Application of the Idea of Symmetry to Crystals.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b7c2s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> M</span>INERALS and other bodies of definite chemical composition often exhibit that marked
regularity of form and structure which we designate
by terming them <i>Crystals</i>; and in such crystals, when
we duly study them, we perceive the various kinds of
symmetry of which we have spoken in the previous
chapter. And the different kinds of symmetry which
we have there described are now usually distinguished
from each other, by writers on crystallography. Indeed
it is mainly to such writers that we are indebted for
a sound and consistent classification of the kinds and
degrees of symmetry of which forms are capable. But
this classification was by no means invented as soon as
mineralogists applied themselves to the study of crystals. These first attempts to arrange crystalline forms
were very imperfect; those, for example, of Linnæus,
Werner, Romé de Lisle, and Haüy. The essays of
these writers implied a classification at once defective
and superfluous. They reduced all crystals to one or
other of certain <i>fundamental forms</i>; and this procedure might have been a perfectly good method of
dividing crystalline forms into classes, if the fundamental forms had been selected so as to exemplify the
different kinds of symmetry. But this was not the
case. Haüy’s fundamental or ‘primitive’ forms, were,
for instance, the following: the <i>parallelepiped</i>, the
<i>octahedron</i>, the <i>tetrahedron</i>, the <i>regular hexagonal
prism</i>, the <i>rhombic dodecahedron</i>, and the <i>double hexagonal pyramid</i>. Of these, the <i>octahedron</i>, the <i>tetrahedron</i>, the <i>rhombic dodecahedron</i>, all belong to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page76">76</a></span> same kind of symmetry (the <span class="sc">tessular</span> systems); also
the <i>hexagonal prism</i> and the <i>hexagonal pyramid</i> both
belong to the <span class="sc">rhombic</span> system; while the <i>parallelepiped</i>
is so employed as to include all kinds of symmetry.</p>
<p>It is, however, to be recollected that Haüy, in his
selection of primitive forms, not only had an eye to
the external form of the crystal and to its degree and
kind of regularity, but also made his classification
with an especial reference to the <em>cleavage</em> of the mineral, which he considered as a primary element in
crystalline analysis. There can be no doubt that the
cleavage of a crystal is one of its most important characters: it is a relation of form belonging to the
interior, which is to be attended to no less than the
form of the exterior. But still, the cleavage is to be
regarded only as determining the degree of geometrical
symmetry of the body, and not as defining a special
geometrical figure to which the body <em>must</em> be referred.
To have looked upon it in the latter light, was a mistake of the earlier crystallographic speculators, on
which we shall shortly have to remark.</p>
<p id="b7c2s2">2. I have said that the reference of crystals to Primitive Forms might have been well employed as a
mode of expressing a just classification of them. This
follows as a consequence from the application of the
Principle stated in the last chapter, that <em>all symmetrical members are alike affected</em>. Thus we may take an
upright triangular prism as the representative of the
rhombic system, and if we then suppose one of the
upper edges to be cut off, or truncated, we must, by
the Principle of Symmetry, suppose the other two
upper edges to be truncated in precisely the same
manner. By this truncation we may obtain the upper
part of a rhombohedron; and by truncations of the
same kind, symmetrically affecting all the analogous
parts of the figure, we may obtain any other form
possessing three-membered symmetry. And the same
is true of any of the other kinds of symmetry, provided we make a proper selection of a fundamental
form. And this was really the method employed
by Demeste, Werner, and Romé de Lisle. They <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page77">77</a></span> assumed a Primitive Form, and then conceived other
forms, such as they found in nature, to be derived
from the Primitive Form by truncation of the edges,
acumination of the corners, and the like processes.
This mode of conception was a perfectly just and legitimate expression of the general Idea of Symmetry.</p>
<p id="b7c2s3">3. The true view of the degrees of symmetry was,
as I have already said, impeded by the attempts which
Haüy and others made to arrive at primitive forms by
the light which cleavage was supposed to throw upon
the structure of minerals. At last, however, in Germany, as I have narrated in the History of Mineralogy<a id="fnanchor4-7" href="#note4-7"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>,
Weiss and Mohs introduced a classification of forms
implying a more philosophical principle, dividing the
forms into Systems; which, employing the terms of
the latter writer, we shall call the <i>tessular</i>, the <i>pyramidal</i> or <i>square pyramidal</i>, the <i>prismatic</i> or <i>oblong</i>,
and the <i>rhombohedral</i> systems.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-7" href="#fnanchor4-7">4</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xv. c. iv.</div>
<p>Of these forms, the three latter may be at once referred to those kinds of symmetry of which we have
spoken in the last chapter. The <i>rhombohedral</i> system
has <i>triangular</i> symmetry, or is three-membered: the
<i>pyramidal</i> has <i>square</i> symmetry, or is four-membered:
the <i>prismatic</i> has <i>oblong</i> symmetry, and is two-and-two-membered. But the kinds of symmetry which were
spoken of in the former chapter, do not exhaust the
idea when applied to minerals. For the symmetry
which was there explained was such only as can be
exhibited on a surface, whereas the forms of crystals
are solid. Not only have the right and left parts of
the upper surface of a crystal relations to each other;
but the upper surface and the lateral faces of the
crystal have also their relations; they may be different,
or they may be alike. If we take a cube, and hold it
so that four of its faces are vertical, not only are all
these four sides exactly similar, so as to give square
symmetry; but also we may turn the cube, so that any
one of these four sides shall become the top, and still
the four sides which are thus made vertical, though <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page78">78</a></span> not the same which were vertical before, are still perfectly symmetrical. Thus this cubical figure possesses
more than square symmetry. It possesses square
symmetry in a vertical as well as in a horizontal sense.
It possesses a symmetry which has the same relation
to a <em>cube</em> which four-membered symmetry has to a
<em>square</em>. And this kind of symmetry is termed the
<i>cubical</i> or <i>tessular</i> symmetry. All the other kinds of
symmetry have reference to an axis, about which the
corresponding parts are disposed; but in tessular symmetry the horizontal and vertical axes are also symmetrical, or interchangeable; and thus the figure may be
said to have no axis at all.</p>
<p id="b7c2s4">4. It has already been repeatedly stated that, by
the very idea of symmetry, all the incidents of form
must affect alike all the corresponding parts. Now in
crystals we have, among these incidents, not only
external figure, but <em>cleavage</em>, which may be considered
as internal figure. Cleavage, then, must conform to
the degree of symmetry of the figure. Accordingly
cleavage, no less than form, is to be attended to in
determining to what system a mineral belongs. If a
crystal were to occur as a square prism or pyramid, it
would not on that account necessarily belong to the
square pyramidal system. If it were found that it
was cleavable parallel to one side of the prism, but not
in the transverse direction, it has only oblong symmetry; and the equality of the sides which makes it
square is only accidental.</p>
<p>Thus no cleavage is admissible in any system of
crystallization which does not agree with the degree of
symmetry of the system. On the other hand, <em>any</em>
cleavage which <em>is</em> consistent with the symmetry of the
system, is (hypothetically at least) allowable. Thus in
the oblong prismatic system we may have a cleavage
parallel to one side only of the prism; or parallel to
both, but of different distinctness; or parallel to the
two diagonals of the prism but of the same distinctness; or we may have both these cleavages together.
In the rhombohedral system, the cleavage may be
parallel to the sides of the rhombohedron, as in Calc <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page79">79</a></span> Spar: or, in the same system, the cleavage, instead of
being thus oblique to the axis, may be along the axis
in those directions which make equal angles with each
other: this cleavage easily gives either a triangular or
a hexagonal prism. Again, in the tessular system,
the cleavage may be parallel to the surface of the
cube, which is thus readily separable into other cubes,
as in Galena; or the cleavage may be such as to cut
off the solid angle of the cube, and since there are
eight of these, such cleavage gives us an octahedron,
which, however, may be reduced to a tetrahedron, by
rejecting all parallel faces, as being mere repetitions of
the same cleavage; this is the case with Fluor Spar:
or the cube of the tessular system may be cleavable in
planes which truncate all the edges of the cube; and
as these are twelve, we thus obtain the dodecahedron
with rhombic faces: this occurs in Zinc Blende. And
thus we see the origin of Haüy’s various primitive
forms, the tetrahedron, octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron, all belonging to the tessular system:&#8212;they
are, in fact, different cleavage forms of that system.</p>
<p id="b7c2s5">5. I do not dwell upon other incidents of crystals
which have reference to form, nor upon the lustre,
smoothness, and striation of the surfaces. To all such
incidents the general principle applies, that similar
parts are similarly affected; and hence, if any parts are
found to be constantly and definitely different from
other parts of the same sort, they are not similar
parts; and the symmetry is to be interpreted with
reference to this difference.</p>
<p>We have now to consider the inferences which have
been drawn from these incidents of crystallization,
with regard to the intimate structure of bodies.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Speculations founded upon the Symmetry of Crystals.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b7c3s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> W</span>HEN
a crystal, as, for instance, a crystal of
Galena, (sulphuret of lead,) is readily divisible into smaller cubes, and these into smaller ones,
and so on without limit, it is very natural to represent
to ourselves the original cube as really consisting of
small cubical elements; and to imagine that it is a philosophical account of the physical structure of such a
substance to say that it is made up of cubical molecules. And when the Galena crystal has externally
the form of a cube, there is no difficulty in such a conception; for the surface of the crystal is also conceived
as made up of the surfaces of its cubical molecules.
We conceive the crystal so constituted, as we conceive
a wall built of bricks.</p>
<p>But if, as often happens, the Galena crystal be an
octahedron, a further consideration is requisite in order
to understand its structure, pursuing still the same
hypothesis. The mineral is still, as in the other case,
readily cleavable into small cubes, having their corners
turned to the faces of the octahedron. Therefore these
faces can no longer be conceived as made up of the
faces of cubical elements of which the whole is constituted. If we suppose a pile of such small cubes to be
closely built together, but with decreasing width above,
so as to form a pyramid, the face of such a pyramid
will no longer be plane; it will consist of a great number of the corners or edges of the small elementary
cubes. It would appear at first sight, therefore, that
such a face cannot represent the smooth polished surface of a crystal. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page81">81</a></span></p>
<p>But when we come to look more closely, this difficulty disappears. For how large are these elementary
cubes? We cannot tell, even supposing they really
have any size. But we know that they must be, at
any rate, very small; so small as to be inappreciable by
our senses, for our senses find no limit to the divisibility of minerals by cleavage. Hence the surface of
the pyramid above described would not consist of
visible corners or edges, but would be roughened by
specks of imperceptible size; or rather, by supposing
these specks to become still smaller, the roughness
becomes smoothness. And thus we may have a crystal
with a smooth surface, made up of small cubes in such
a manner that their surfaces are all oblique to the surface of the crystal.</p>
<p>Haüy, struck by some instances in which the supposition of such a structure of crystals appeared to account happily for several of their relations and properties, adopted and propounded it as a general theory.
The small elements, of which he supposed crystals to
be thus built up, he termed <i>integrant molecules</i>. The
form of these molecules might or might not be the
same as the <i>primitive form</i> with which his construction was supposed to begin; but there was, at any rate,
a close connexion between these forms, since both of
them were founded on the cleavage of the mineral.
The tenet that crystals are constituted in the manner
which I have been describing, I shall call the <i>Theory
of Integrant Molecules</i>, and I have now to make some
remarks on the grounds of this theory.</p>
<p id="b7c3s2">2. In the case of which I have spoken, the mineral
used as the example, Galena, readily splits into cubes,
and cubes are easily placed together so as to fit each
other, and fill the space which they occupy. The same
is the case in the mineral which suggested to Haüy his
theory, namely, Calc Spar. The crystals of this substance are readily divisible into rhombohedrons, a
form like a brick with oblique angles; and such bricks
can be built together so as to produce crystals of all the
immense varieties of form which Calc Spar presents.
This kind of masonry is equally possible in many other <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page82">82</a></span> minerals; but as we go through the mineral kingdom
in our survey, we soon find cases which offer difficulties. Some minerals cleave only in two directions,
some in one only; in such cases we cannot by cleavage
obtain an integrant molecule of definite form; one of
its dimensions, at least, must remain indeterminate
and arbitrary. Again, in some instances, we have
more than three different planes of cleavage, as in
Fluor Spar, where we have four. The solid, bounded
by four planes, is a tetrahedron; or if we take four
<i>pairs</i> of parallel faces, an octahedron. But if we
attempt to take either of these forms for our integrant
molecule, we are met by this difficulty: that a collection of such forms will not fill space. Perhaps this
difficulty will be more readily conceived by the general
reader if it be contemplated with reference to plane
figures. It will readily be seen that a number of
equal squares may be put together so as to fill the
space which they occupy; but if we take a number of
equal regular octagons, we may easily convince ourselves that no possible arrangement can make them
cover a flat space without leaving blank spots between.
In like manner octahedrons or tetrahedrons cannot be
arranged in solid space so as to fill it. They necessarily leave vacancies. Hence the structure of Fluor
Spar, and similar crystals, was a serious obstacle in the
way of the theory of integrant molecules. That theory
had been adopted in the first instance because portions of the crystal, obtained by cleavage, could be
built up into a solid mass; but this ground of the
theory failed altogether in such instances as I have
described, and hence the theory, even upon the representations of its adherents, had no longer any claim to
assent.</p>
<p>The doctrine of Integral Molecules, however, was
by no means given up at once, even in such instances.
In this and in other subjects, we may observe that a
theory, once constructed and carried into detail, has
such a hold upon the minds of those who have been in
the habit of applying it, that they will attempt to uphold it by introducing suppositions inconsistent with <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page83">83</a></span> the original foundations of the theory. Thus those who
assert the Atomic Theory, reconcile it with facts by
taking the <em>halves of atoms</em>; and thus the Theory of Integrant Molecules was maintained for Fluor Spar, by
representing the elementary octahedrons of which crystals are built up, as touching each other only by the
<em>edges</em>. The contact of surface with surface amongst
integrant molecules had been the first basis of the
theory; but this supposition being here inapplicable,
was replaced by one which made the theory no longer
a representation of the facts (the cleavages), but a
mere geometrical construction. Although, however,
the inapplicability of the theory to such cases was thus,
in some degree, disguised to the disciples of Haüy, it
was plain that, in the face of such difficulties, the
Theory of Integrant Molecules could not hold its place
as a philosophical truth. But it still answered the
purpose (a very valuable one, and one to which crystallography is much indebted,) of an instrument for calculating the geometrical relations of the parts of crystals
to each other: for the integrant molecules were supposed to be placed layer above layer, each layer as we
ascend, <em>decreasing</em> by a certain number of molecules
and rows of molecules; and the calculation of these
<i>laws of decrement</i> was, in fact, the best mode then
known of determining the positions of the faces. The
Theory of Decrements served to express and to determine, in a great number of the most obvious cases, <i>the
laws of phenomena</i> in crystalline forms, though the
Theory of Integrant Molecules could not be maintained
as a just view of the structure of crystals.</p>
<p id="b7c3s3">3. The Theory of Integrant Molecules, however, involved this just and important principle: that a true
view of the intimate structure of crystals must include
and explain the facts of crystallization, that is, crystalline form and cleavage; and that it must take these
into account, according to their degree of <i>Symmetry</i>.
So far all theories concerning the elements of crystals
must agree. And it was soon seen that this was, in
reality, all that had been established by the investigations of Haüy and his school. I have already, in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page84">84</a></span> <i>History</i>, quoted Weiss’s reflections on making this
step. ‘When in 1809,’ he says<a id="fnanchor5-7" href="#note5-7"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>, ‘I published my
Dissertation, I shared the common opinion as to the
necessity of the assumption, and the reality of the existence of a primitive form, at least in a sense not very
different from the usual sense of the expression.’ He
then proceeds to relate that he sought a ground for
such an opinion, independent of the doctrine of <i>Atoms</i>,
which he, in common with a great number of philosophers of that time in his own country, was disposed to
reject, inclining to believe that the properties of bodies
were determined by <em>Forces</em> which acted in them, and
not by <em>Molecules</em> of which they were composed. He
adds, that in pursuing this train of thought, he found,
‘that out of his Primitive Forms there was gradually
unfolded to his hands that which really governs them,
and is not affected by their casual fluctuations; namely,
the Fundamental Relations of their Dimensions,’ or as
we now may call them, <i>Axes of Symmetry</i>. With
reference to these Axes, he found, as he goes on to say,
that ‘a multiplicity of internal Oppositions, necessarily
and mutually interdependent, are developed in the
crystalline mass, each Relation having its own Polarity;
so that the Crystalline Character is co-extensive with
these Polarities.’ The character of these polarities,
whether manifested in crystalline faces, cleavage, or
any other incidents of crystallization, is necessarily displayed in the degree and kind of Symmetry which the
crystal possesses: and thus this Symmetry, in all our
speculations concerning the structure of crystals, necessarily takes the place of that enumeration of Primitive
Forms which were rejected as inconsistent with observed
facts, and destitute of sound scientific principle.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-7" href="#fnanchor5-7">5</a></span> <i>Acad. Berlin.</i> 1816, p. 307.</div>
<p>I may just notice here what I have stated in the
History of Mineralogy<a id="fnanchor6-7" href="#note6-7"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>, that the distinction of systems
of crystallization, as introduced by Weiss and Mohs,
was strikingly confirmed by Sir David Brewster’s discoveries respecting the optical properties of minerals. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page85">85</a></span> The splendid phenomena which were produced by
passing polarized light through crystals, were found to
vary according as the crystals were of the Rhombohedral, Square Pyramidal, Oblong Prismatic, or Tessular
System. The Optical Symmetry exactly corresponded
with the Geometrical Symmetry. In the two former
Systems were crystals <i>uniaxal</i> in respect of their optical
properties; the oblong prismatic, was <i>biaxal</i>; while in
the tessular, the want of a predominant axis prevented
the phenomena here spoken of from occurring at all.
The optical experiments must have led, and would have
led, to a classification of crystals into the above systems
or something nearly equivalent, even had they not been
already so arranged by attention to their forms.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-7" href="#fnanchor6-7">6</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xv. c. v.</div>
<p id="b7c3s4">4. While in Germany Weiss and Mohs with their
disciples, were gradually rejecting what was superfluous
in the previous crystallographical hypotheses, philosophers in England were also trying to represent to
themselves the constitution of crystals in a manner
which should be free from the obviously arbitrary and
untenable fictions of the Haüyian school. These
attempts, however, were not crowned with much success. One mode of representing the structure of crystals which suggested itself, was to reject the polyhedral
forms which Haüy gave to his integrant molecules,
and to conceive the elements of crystals as <i>spheres</i>, the
properties of the crystal being determined not by the
<em>surfaces</em>, but by the <em>position</em> of the elements. This was
done by Wollaston, in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
for 1813. He applied this view to the tessular system,
in which, indeed, the application is not difficult; and
he showed that octahedral and tetrahedral figures may
be deduced from symmetrical arrangements of equal
spherules. But though in doing this, he manifested a
perception of the conditions of the problem, he appeared to lose his hold on the real question when he
tried to pass on to other systems of crystallization.
For he accounted for the rhombohedral system by supposing the spheres changed into <i>spheroids</i>. Such a
procedure involved him in a gratuitous and useless
hypothesis: for to what purpose do we introduce the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page86">86</a></span> arrangement of atoms (instead of their figure,) as a
mode of explaining the symmetry of the crystallization, when at the next step we ascribe to the atom, by
an arbitrary fiction, a symmetry of figure of the same
kind as that which we have to explain? It is just as
easy, and as allowable, to assume an elementary rhombohedron, as to assume elementary spheroids, of which
the rhombohedrons are constructed.</p>
<p id="b7c3s5">5. Many hypotheses of the same kind might be
adduced, devised both by mineralogists and chemists.
But almost all such speculations have been pursued
with a most surprising neglect of the principle which
obviously is the only sound basis on which they can
proceed. The principle is this:&#8212;that <em>All hypotheses
concerning the arrangement of the elementary atoms of
bodies in space must be constructed with reference to the
general facts of crystallization</em>. The truth and importance of this principle can admit of no doubt. For
if we make any hypothesis concerning the mode of
connexion of the elementary particles of bodies, this
must be done with the view of representing to ourselves the forces which connect them, and the results
of these forces as manifested in the properties of the
bodies. Now the forces which connect the particles
of bodies so as to make them crystalline, are manifestly
chemical forces. It is only definite chemical compounds which crystallize; and in crystals the force of
cohesion by which the particles are held together cannot in any way be distinguished or separated from the
chemical force by which their elements are combined.
The elements are understood to be combined, precisely
because the result is a definite, apparently homogeneous substance. The properties of the compound
bodies depend upon the elements and their mode of
combination; for, in fact, these include everything on
which they can depend. There are no other circumstances than these which can affect the properties of
a body. Therefore all those properties which have
reference to space, namely, the crystalline properties,
cannot depend upon anything else than the arrangement of the elementary molecules in space. These <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page87">87</a></span> properties are the facts which any hypothesis of the
arrangement of molecules must explain, or at least
render conceivable; and all such hypotheses, all constructions of bodies by supposed arrangements of
molecules, can have no other philosophical object than
to account for facts of this kind. If they do not do
this, they are mere arbitrary geometrical fictions, which
cannot be in any degree confirmed or authorised by an
examination of nature, and are therefore not deserving
of any regard.</p>
<p id="b7c3s6">6. Those philosophers who have endeavoured to
represent the mode in which bodies are constructed by
the combination of their chemical atoms, have often
undertaken to show, not only that the atoms are combined, but also in what positions and configurations
they are combined. And it is truly remarkable, as I
have already said, that they have done this, almost in
every instance, without any consideration of the crystalline character of the resulting combinations; from
which alone we receive any light as to the relation of
their elements in space. Thus Dr. Dalton, in his
<i>Elements of Chemistry</i>, in which he gave to the world
the Atomic Theory as a representation of the doctrine
of definite and multiple proportions, also published a
large collection of Diagrams, exhibiting what he conceived to be the configuration of the atoms in a great
number of the most common combinations of chemical
elements. Now these hypothetical diagrams do not in
any way correspond, as to the nature of their symmetry, with the compounds, as we find them displaying
their symmetry when they occur crystallized. Carbonate of lime has in reality a triangular symmetry,
since it belongs to the rhombohedral system; Dr. Dalton’s carbonate of lime would be an oblique rhombic
prism or pyramid. Sulphate of baryta is really two-and-two membered; Dr. Dalton’s diagram makes it
two-and-one membered. Alum is really octahedral or
tessular; but according to the diagram it could not be
so, since the two ends of the atom are not symmetrical.
And the same want of correspondence between the
facts and the hypothesis runs through the whole <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page88">88</a></span> system. It need not surprise us that the theoretical
arrangement of atoms does not explain the facts of
<i>crystallization</i>; for to produce such an explanation
would be a second step in science quite as great as the
first, the discovery of the atomic theory in its <em>chemical</em>
sense. But we may allow ourselves to be surprised
that an utter discrepance between all the facts of crystallization and the figures assumed in the theory, did
not suggest any doubt as to the soundness of the mode
of philosophizing by which this part of the theory was
constructed.</p>
<p id="b7c3s7">7. Some little accordance between the hypothetical
arrangements of chemical atoms and the facts of crystallization, does appear to have been arrived at by
some of the theorists to whom we here refer, although
by no means enough to show a due conviction of the
importance of the principle stated above. Thus Wollaston, in the Essay above noticed, after showing that
a symmetrical arrangement of equal spherules would
give rise to octahedral and other tessular figures,
remarks, very properly, that the metals, which are
simple bodies, crystallize in such forms. M. Ampère<a id="fnanchor7-7" href="#note7-7"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>
also, in 1814, published a brief account of an hypothesis of a somewhat similar nature, and stated himself to have developed this speculation in a Memoir
which has not yet, so far as I am aware, been published.
In this notice he conceives bodies to be compounded
of <i>molecules</i>, which, arranged in a polyhedral form,
constitute <i>particles</i>. These <i>representative forms</i> of the
particles depend on chemical laws. Thus the particles
of oxygen, of hydrogen, and of azote, are composed
each of four molecules. Hence it is collected that the
particles of nitrous gas are composed of two molecules
of oxygen and two of azote; and similar conclusions
are drawn respecting other substances. These conclusions, though expressed by means of the polyhedrons
thus introduced, are supported by chemical, rather
than by crystallographical comparisons. The author
does, indeed, appeal to the crystallization of sal <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page89">89</a></span> ammoniac as an argument<a id="fnanchor8-7" href="#note8-7"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>; but as <em>all</em> the forms which he
introduces appear to belong to the <i>tessular</i> system of
crystallization, there is, in his reasonings, nothing distinctive; and therefore nothing, crystallographically
speaking, of any weight on the side of this theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-7" href="#fnanchor7-7">7</a></span> <i>Ann. de Chimie</i>, tom. xc. p. 43.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-7" href="#fnanchor8-7">8</a></span> <i>Ann. de Chimie</i>, tom. xc. p. 83.</div>
<p id="b7c3s8">8. Any hypothesis which should introduce any
principle of chemical order among the actual forms of
minerals, would well deserve attention. At first sight,
nothing can appear more anomalous than the forms
which occur. We have, indeed, one broad fact, which
has an encouraging aspect, the tessular forms in which
the pure metals crystallize. The highest degree of
chemical and of geometrical simplicity coincide: irregularity disappears precisely where it is excluded by
the consideration above stated, that the symmetry of
chemical composition must determine the symmetry of
crystalline form<a id="fnanchor9-7" href="#note9-7"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-7" href="#fnanchor9-7">9</a></span> Inasmuch as this law, that the
simple metals crystallize in tessular
forms, is the most signal example of
that connexion between the chemical
nature of a body and its crystalline
form, I in the former Edition stated
it with as much generality as I could
find any ground for, and I should
have been glad if I could have added
confirmation of the law, derived from
later observations. But the most
recent investigations of crystallographers appear to have afforded exceptions rather than examples of the
rule. Arsenic and Tellurium are
said to be <i>rhombohedral</i>. Antimony,
stated by Haüy to be octahedral (and
therefore tessular), has been found by
more modern observers to be <i>rhombohedral</i>. Tin has been obtained by
Professor Miller in beautiful crystals
belonging to the <i>pyramidal</i> system.
Professor Nöggerath has observed in
Zinc, after cooling from fusion, hexagonal cleavage, rendering it probable
that the mineral crystallized in <i>rhombohedrons</i> having their axes vertical,
like ice. G. Rose conceives it highly
probable that Osmium and Iridium
are <i>rhombohedral</i>. (Poggendorf. Bd. liv.)<br/>
&#8195;But all the more perfect metals are
tessular; namely, Gold, Silver, Mercury, Platinum, Iron, Copper; also
Bismuth [?] Perhaps the observation
in which the crystallization of Zinc
is affected by its position is, on that
very account, no sufficient evidence
of its free crystallization. We can
hardly conceive a collection of perfectly simple, similar particles to
crystallize so as to have one pre-eminent axis, without some extraneous action affecting them.</div>
<p>But if we go on to any other class of crystalline
forms, we soon find ourselves lost in our attempts to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page90">90</a></span> follow any thread of order. We have indeed many
large groups connected by obvious analogies; as the
rhombohedral carbonates of lime, magnesia, iron, manganese;&#8212;the prismatic carbonates and sulphates of
lime, baryta, strontia, lead. But even in these, we
cannot form any plausible hypothesis of the arrangement of the elements; and in other cases to which we
naturally turn, we can find nothing but confusion.
For instance, if we examine the oxides of metals:&#8212;those of iron are rhombohedral and tessular; those of
copper, tessular; those of tin, of titanium, of manganese, square pyramidal; those of antimony, prismatic;
and we have other forms for other substances.</p>
<p>It may be added, that if we take account of the
optical properties which, as we have already stated,
have constant relations to the crystalline forms, the
confusion is still further increased; for the optical
dimensions vary in amount, though not in symmetry,
where chemistry can trace no difference of composition.</p>
<p id="b7c3s9">9. We will not quit the subject, however, without
noticing the much more promising aspect which it has
assumed by the detection of such groups as are referred
to in the last article; or in other words, by Mitscherlich’s discovery of <i>Isomorphism</i>. According to that
discovery, there are various elements which may take
the place of each other in crystalline bodies, either
without any alteration of the crystalline form, or at
most with only a slight alteration of its dimensions.
Such a group of elements we have in the earths lime
and magnesia, the protoxides of iron and manganese:
for the carbonates of all these bases occur crystallized
in forms of the rhombohedral system, the characteristic angle being nearly the same in all. Now lime and
magnesia, by the discoveries of modern chemistry, are
really oxides of metals; and therefore all these carbonates have a similar chemical constitution, while they
have also a similar crystalline form. Whether or no
we can devise any arrangement of molecules by which
this connexion of the chemical and the geometrical
property can be represented, we cannot help <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page91">91</a></span> considering the connexion as an extremely important fact in
the constitution of bodies; and such facts are more
likely than any other to give us some intelligible view
of the relations of the ultimate parts of bodies. The
same may be said of all the other isomorphous or plesiomorphous groups<a id="fnanchor10-7" href="#note10-7"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>. For instance, we have a number of minerals which belong to the same system of
crystallization, but in which the chemical composition
appears at first sight to be very various: namely, spinelle, pleonaste, gahnite, franklinite, chromic iron
oxide, magnetic iron oxide: but Abich has shown that
all these may be reduced to a common chemical formula;&#8212;they are bioxides of one set of bases, combined
with trioxides of another set. Perhaps some mathematician may be able to devise some geometrical arrangement of such a group of elements which may possess
the properties of the tessular system. Hypothetical
arrangements of atoms, thus expressing both the chemical and the crystalline symmetry which we know
to belong to the substance, would be valuable steps in
analytical science; and when they had been duly verified, the hypotheses might easily be divested of their
atomic character.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-7" href="#fnanchor10-7">10</a></span> See <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xv. c. vi.</div>
<p>Thus, as we have already said, mineralogy, understood in its wider sense, as the counterpart of chemistry, has for one of its main objects to discover those
Relations of the Elements of bodies which have reference to Space. In this research, the foundation of all
sound speculation is the kind and degree of Symmetry
of form which we find in definite chemical compounds:
and the problem at present before the inquirer is, to
devise such arrangements of molecules as shall answer
the conditions alike of Chemistry and of Crystallography.</p>
<p>We now proceed to the Classificatory Sciences, of
which Mineralogy is one, though hitherto by far the
least successful.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">The Idea of Likeness as Governing the Use of Common Names.</span></h3>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b8c1s1">1. <i>Object of the Chapter.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">Not</span> only the Classificatory Sciences, but the application of names to things
in the rudest and most unscientific manner, depends
upon our apprehending them as <em>like</em> each other. We
must therefore endeavour to trace the influence and
operation of the Idea of Likeness in the common use
of language, before we speak of the conditions under
which it acquires its utmost exactness and efficacy.</p>
<p>It will be my object to show in this, as in previous
cases, that the impressions of sense are apprehended
by acts of the mind; and that these mental acts necessarily imply certain relations which may be made the
subjects of speculative reasoning. We shall have, if
we can, to seize and bring into clear view the principles which the relation of <i>like</i> and <i>unlike</i> involves, and
the mode in which these principles have been developed.</p>
<p id="b8c1s2">2. <i>Unity of the Individual.</i>&#8212;But before we can
attend to several things as like or unlike, we must be
able to apprehend each of these by itself as <em>one thing</em>. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page96">96</a></span> It may at first sight perhaps appear that this apprehension results immediately from the impressions on
our senses, without any act of our thoughts. A very
little attention, however, enables us to see that thus to
single out special objects requires a mental operation
as well as a sensation. How, for example, without an
exertion of mental activity, can we see one tree, in a
forest where there are many? We have, spread before us, a collection of colours and forms, green and
brown, dark and light, irregular and straight: this is
all that sensation gives or can give. But we associate
one brown trunk with one portion of the green mass,
excluding the rest, although the neighbouring leaves
are both nearer in contiguity and more similar in
appearance than is the stem. We thus have before us
one tree; but this unity is given by the mind itself.
We see the green and the brown, but we must <em>make</em>
the tree before we can see <em>it</em>.</p>
<p>That this composition of our sensations so as to
form <em>one thing</em> implies an act of our own, will perhaps
be more readily allowed, if we once more turn our
attention to the manner in which we sometimes attempt
to imitate and record the objects of sight, by drawing.
When we do this, as we have already observed, we
mark this unity of each object, by drawing a line to
separate the parts which we include from those which
we exclude;&#8212;an <i>Outline</i>. This line corresponds to
nothing which we see; the beginner in drawing has
great difficulty in discerning it; he has in fact to make
it. It is, as has been said by a painter of our own
time<a id="fnanchor1-8" href="#note1-8"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>, a fiction: but it is a fiction employed to mark
a real act of the mind; to designate the singleness of
the object in our conception. As we have said elsewhere, we see lines, but especially outlines, by mentally drawing them ourselves.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-8" href="#fnanchor1-8">1</a></span> Phillips <i>On Painting</i>,&#8212;Design.</div>
<p>The same act of conception which the outline thus
represents and commemorates in visible objects,&#8212;the
same combination of sensible impressions into a unit,&#8212;is exercised also with regard to the objects of all <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page97">97</a></span> our senses: and the singleness thus given to each
object, is a necessary preliminary to its being named
or represented in any other way.</p>
<p>But it may be said, Is it then by an arbitrary act
of our own that we put together the branches of the
same tree, or the limbs of the same animal? Have we
equally the power and the right to make the branch
of the fir a part of the neighbouring oak? Can we
include in the outline of a man any object with which
he happens to be in contact?</p>
<p>Such suppositions are manifestly absurd. And the
answer is, that though we give unity to objects by an
act of thought, it is not by an <em>arbitrary</em> act; but by
a process subject to certain conditions;&#8212;to conditions
which exclude such incongruous combinations as have
just been spoken of.</p>
<p>What are these conditions which regulate our apprehension of an object as one?&#8212;which determine
what portion of our impressions does, and what portion does not belong to the same thing?</p>
<p id="b8c1s3">3. <i>Condition of Unity.</i>&#8212;I reply, that the primary
and fundamental condition is, that we must be able to
make intelligible assertions respecting the object, and
to entertain that belief of which assertions are the
exposition. A tree <i>grows</i>, <i>sheds</i> its leaves in autumn,
and <i>buds</i> again in the spring, <i>waves</i> in the wind, or
<i>falls</i> before the storm. And to the tree belong all
those parts which must be included in order that such
declarations, and the thought which they convey, shall
have a coherent and permanent meaning. Those are
<em>its</em> branches which wave and fall with <em>its</em> trunk; those
are <em>its</em> leaves which grow on <em>its</em> branches. The permanent connexions which we observe,&#8212;permanent, among
unconnected changes which affect the surrounding
appearances,&#8212;are what we bind together as belonging
to one object. This permanence is the condition of
our conceiving the object <em>as</em> one. The connected
changes may always be described by means of assertions; and the connexion is seen in the identity of the
subject of successive predications; in the possibility of
applying many verbs to one substantive. We may <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page98">98</a></span> therefore express the condition of the unity of an
object to be this: that <em>assertions concerning the object
shall be possible</em>: or rather we should say, that the acts
of belief which such assertions enunciate shall be possible.</p>
<p>It may seem to be superfluous to put in a form so
abstract and remote, the grounds of a process apparently so simple as our conceiving an object to be one.
But the same condition to which we have thus been
led, as the essential principle of the unity of objects,
namely, that propositions shall be possible, will repeatedly occur in the present chapter; and it may
serve to illustrate our views, to show that this condition pervades even the simplest cases.</p>
<p id="b8c1s4">4. <i>Kinds.</i>&#8212;The mental synthesis of which we have
thus spoken, gives us our knowledge of <em>individual</em>
things; it enables me to apprehend that particular
tree or man which I now see, or, by the help of memory,
the tree or the man I saw yesterday. But the knowledge with which we have mainly here to do is not
a knowledge of individuals but of kinds; of such
classes as are indicated by common names. We have
to make assertions concerning a tree or a man in general, without regarding what is peculiar to this man or
that tree.</p>
<p>Now it is clear that certain individual objects are
all called <i>man</i>, or all called <i>tree</i>, in virtue of some resemblance which they have. If we had not the power
of perceiving in the appearances around us, likeness
and unlikeness, we could not consider objects as distributed into kinds at all. The impressions of sense
would throng upon us, but being uncompared with
each other, they would flow away like the waves of the
sea, and each vanish from our contemplation when the
sensation faded. That we do apprehend surrounding
objects as belonging to permanent kinds, as being men
and horses, oaks and roses, arises from our having the
idea of likeness, and from our applying it habitually,
and so far as such a classification requires.</p>
<p>Not only can we employ the idea of likeness in this
manner, but we apply it incessantly and universally to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page99">99</a></span> the whole mass and train of our sensations. For we
have no external sensations to which we cannot apply
some language or other; and all language necessarily
implies recognition of resemblances. We cannot call
an object <i>green</i> or <i>round</i> without comparing in our
thoughts its colour or its shape, with a shape and
a colour seen in other objects. All our sensations,
therefore, without any exception of kind or time, are
subject to this constant process of classification; and
the idea of likeness is perpetually operating to distribute them into kinds, at least so far as the use of
language requires.</p>
<p>We come then again to the question, Upon what
principle, under what conditions, is the Idea of Likeness
thus operative? What are the limits of the classes
thus formed? Where does that similarity end, which
induces and entitles us to call a thing a <i>tree</i>? What
universal rule is there for the application of common
names, so that we may not apply them wrongly?</p>
<p id="b8c1s5">5. <i>Not made by Definitions.</i>&#8212;Perhaps some one
might expect in answer to these inquiries a definition
or a series of definitions;&#8212;might imagine that some
description of a tree might be given which might show
when the term was applicable and when it was not;
and that we might construct a body of rules to which
such descriptions must conform. But on consideration
it will be clear that the real solution of our difficulty
cannot be obtained in such a manner. For <i>first</i>; such
descriptions must be given in words, and must therefore
suppose that we have already satisfied ourselves how
words are to be used. If we define a tree to be ‘a
living thing without the power of voluntary motion,’
we shall be called upon to define ‘a living thing;’ and
it is manifest that this renewal of the demand for
definition might be repeated indefinitely; and, therefore, we cannot in this way come to a final principle.
And in the <i>next</i> place, most of those who use language,
even with great precision and consistency, would find
it difficult or impossible to give good definitions even
of a few of the general names which they use; and
therefore their practice cannot be regulated by any <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page100">100</a></span> tacit reference to such definitions. That definitions of
terms are of great use and importance in their right
place, we shall soon see; but their place is not to
regulate the use of common language.</p>
<p>What then, once more, is this regulative principle?
What rules do men follow in the use of words, so as
commonly to avoid confusion and ambiguity? How do
they come to understand each other so well as they
ordinarily do, respecting the limits of classes never
defined, and which they cannot define? What is the
common Convention, or Condition to which they conform?</p>
<p id="b8c1s6">6. <i>Condition of the Use of Terms.</i>&#8212;To this we reply,
that the Condition which regulates the use of language, is, that it shall be capable of being used;&#8212;that
is, that general assertions shall be possible. The term
<i>tree</i> is applicable as far as it is useful in expressing our
knowledge concerning trees:&#8212;thus we know that trees
are fixed in the ground, have a solid stem, branches,
leaves, and many other properties. With regard to
all the objects which surround us, we have an immense store of knowledge of such properties, and we
employ the names of the objects in such a manner as
enables us to express these properties.</p>
<p>But the connexion of such properties is variable and
indefinite. Some properties are constantly combined,
others occasionally only. The leaves of different oaks
resemble each other, the branches resemble far less,
and may differ very widely. The term <i>oak</i> does not
enable us to say that all oaks have straight branches
or all crooked. Terms can only express properties as
far as they are constant. Not only, therefore, the
accumulation of a vast mass of knowledge of the properties and attributes of objects, but also an observation of the habitual <em>connexion</em> of such properties is
needed, to direct us to the consistent application of
terms:&#8212;to enable us to apply them so as to express
truths. But here again we are largely provided with
the requisite knowledge and observation by the common course of our existence. The unintermitting
stream of experience supplies us with an incalculable <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page101">101</a></span> amount of such observed connexions. All men have
observed that the associations of the same form of
leaves are more constant than of the same form of
branches;&#8212;that though persons walk in different attitudes, none go on all fours; and thus the term <i>oak</i> is
so applied as to include those cases in which the
leaves are alike in form though the branches be unlike;
and though we should refuse to apply the term <i>man</i>
to a class of creatures which habitually and without
compulsion used four legs, we make no scruple of affixing it to persons of very different figures. The whole
of human experience being composed of such observed
connexions, we have thus materials even for the immense multiplicity of names which human language
contains; all which names are, as we have said, regulated in their application by the condition of their expressing such experience.</p>
<p>Thus amid the countless combinations of properties
and divisions of classes which the structure of language implies, scarcely any are arbitrary or capricious.
A word which expressed a mere wanton collection of
unconnected attributes could hardly be called a <i>word</i>;
for of such a collection of properties no truth could be
asserted, and the word would disappear, for want of
some occasion on which it could be used. Though much
of the fabric of language appears, not unnaturally, fantastical and purely conventional, it is in fact otherwise.
The associations and distinctions of phraseology are not
more fanciful than is requisite to make them correspond to the apparent caprices of nature or of thought;
and though much in language may be called conventional, the conventions exist for the sake of expressing
some truth or opinion, and not for their own sake.
The principle, that <em>the condition of the use of terms is
the possibility of general, intelligible, consistent assertions</em>, is true in the most complete and extensive sense.</p>
<p id="b8c1s7">7. <i>Terms may have different Uses.</i>&#8212;The Terms
with which we are here most concerned are Names of
Classes of natural objects; and when we say that the
principle and the limit of such Names are their use in
expressing propositions concerning the classes, it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page102">102</a></span> clear that much will depend on the kind of propositions which we mainly have to express: and that the
same name may have different limits, according to the
purpose we have in view. For example, is the <i>whale</i>
properly included in the general term <i>fish</i>? When
men are concerned in catching marine animals, the
main features of the process are the same however the
animals may differ; hence whales are classed with
fishes, and we speak of the <i>whale-fishery</i>. But if we
look at the analogies of organization, we find that, according to these, the whale is clearly not a fish, but a
<i>beast</i>, (confining this term, for the sake of distinctness,
to suckling beasts or <i>mammals</i>). In Natural History,
therefore, the whale is not included among fish. The
indefinite and miscellaneous propositions which language is employed to enunciate in the course of common practical life, are replaced by a more coherent
and systematic collection of properties, when we come
to aim at scientific knowledge. But we shall hereafter
consider the principle of the classifications of Natural
History; our present subject is the application of the
Idea of Likeness in common practice and common language.</p>
<p id="b8c1s8">8. <i>Gradation of Kinds.</i>&#8212;Common names, then,
include many individuals associated in virtue of resemblances, and of permanently connected properties; and
such names are applicable as far as they serve to express such properties. These collections of individuals
are termed <i>Kinds</i>, <i>Sorts</i>, <i>Classes</i>.</p>
<p>But this association of particulars is capable of
degrees. As individuals by their resemblances form
Kinds, so kinds of things, though different, may resemble each other so as to be again associated in a higher
Class; and there may be several successive steps of
such classification. <i>Man</i>, <i>horse</i>, <i>tree</i>, <i>stone</i>, are each a
name of a Kind; but <i>animal</i> includes the two first
and excludes the others; <i>living thing</i> is a term which
includes <i>animal</i> and <i>tree</i> but not <i>stone</i>; <i>body</i> includes
all the four. And such a subordination of kinds may
be traced very widely in the arrangements of language. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page103">103</a></span></p>
<p>The condition of the use of the wider is the same as
that of the narrower Names of Classes;&#8212;they are
good as far as they serve to express true propositions.
In common language, though such an order of generality may in a variety of instances be easily discerned, it is not systematically and extensively referred
to; but this subordination and graduated comprehensiveness is the essence of the methods and nomenclatures of Natural History, as we shall soon have to
show.</p>
<p>But such subordination is not without its use, even
in common cases, and when it is expressed in the
terms of common language. Thus <i>organized body</i> is a
term which includes plants and animals; <i>animal</i> includes beasts, birds, fishes; <i>beast</i> includes horses and
dogs; <i>dogs</i>, again, are greyhounds, spaniels, terriers.</p>
<p id="b8c1s9">9. <i>Characters of Kinds.</i>&#8212;Now when we have such
a Series of Names and Classes, we find that we take
for granted irresistibly that each class has some <em>Character</em> which distinguishes it from other classes included
in the superior division. We ask what kind of beast
a dog is; what kind of animal a beast is; and we
assume that such questions admit of answer;&#8212;that
each kind has some mark or marks by which it may
be described. And such descriptions may be given:
an animal is an organized body <i>having sensation and
volition</i>; man is a <i>reasonable</i> animal. Whether or no
we assent to the exactness of these definitions, we
allow the propriety of their form. If we maintain
these definitions to be wrong, we must believe some
others to be right, however difficult it may be to hit
upon them. We entertain a conviction that there must
be, among things so classed and named, a possibility of
defining each.</p>
<p>Now what is the foundation of this postulate? What
is the ground of this assumption, that there must exist
a definition which we have never seen, and which perhaps no one has seen in a satisfactory form? The
knowledge of this definition is by no means necessary
to our using the word with propriety; for any one can
make true assertions about dogs, but who can define a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page104">104</a></span> dog? And yet if the definition be not necessary to
enable us to use the word, why is it necessary at all?
I allow that we possess an indestructible conviction
that there must be such a character of each kind as
will supply a definition; but I ask, on what this conviction rests.</p>
<p>I reply, that our persuasion that there must needs
be characteristic marks by which things can be defined in words, is founded on the assumption of <em>the
necessary possibility of reasoning</em>.</p>
<p>The reference of any object or conception to its
class without definition, may give us a persuasion that
it shares the properties of its class, but such classing
does not enable us to reason upon those properties.
When we consider man as an animal, we ascribe to
him in thought the appetites, desires, affections, which
we habitually include in our notion of animal: but
except we have expressed these in some definition or
acknowledged description of the term <i>animal</i>, we can
make no use of the persuasion in ratiocination. But
if we have described animals as ‘being impelled to
action by appetites and passions,’ we can not only
think, but say, ‘man is an animal, and therefore he
is impelled to act by appetites and passions.’ And if
we add a further definition, that ‘man is a reasonable
animal,’ and if it appear that ‘reason implies conformity to a rule of action,’ we can then further infer
that man’s nature is to conform the results of animal
appetite and passion to a rule of action.</p>
<p>The possibility of pursuing any such train of reasoning as this, depends on the definitions, of <i>animal</i> and
of <i>man</i>, which we have introduced; and the possibility
of reasoning concerning the objects around us being
inevitably assumed by us from the constitution of our
nature, we assume consequently the possibility of such
definitions as may thus form part of our deduction,
and the existence of such defining characters.</p>
<p id="b8c1s10">10. <i>Difficulty of Definitions.</i>&#8212;But though men are,
on such grounds, led to make constant and importunate <em>demands</em> for definitions of the terms which they
employ in their speculations, they are, in fact, far <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page105">105</a></span> from being able to carry into complete effect the postulate on which they proceed, that they must be able
to find definitions which by logical consequence shall
lead to the truths they seek. The postulate overlooks
the process by which our classes of things are formed
and our names applied. This process consisting, as
we have already said, in observing permanent connexions of properties, and in fixing them by the attribution of names, is of the nature of the process
of Induction, of which we shall afterwards have to
speak. And the postulate is so far true, that this
process of induction being once performed, its result
may usually be expressed by means of a few definitions, and may thus lead by a deduction to a train
of real truths.</p>
<p>But in the subjects where we principally find such a
subordination of classes as we have spoken of, this
process of deduction is rarely of much prominence: for
example, in the branches of natural history. Yet it is
in these subjects that the existence and importance of
these characteristic marks, which we have spoken of,
principally comes into view. In treating of these
marks, however, we enter upon methods which are
technical and scientific, not popular and common. And
before we make this transition, we have a remark to
make on the manner in which writers, without reference to physics or natural history, have spoken of
kinds, their subordination, and their marks.</p>
<p id="b8c1s11">11. ‘<i>The Five Words.</i>‘&#8212;These things,&#8212;the Nature
and Relations of Classes,&#8212;were, in fact, the subjects of
minute and technical treatment by the logicians of the
school of Aristotle. Porphyry wrote an Introduction
to the <i>Categories</i> of that philosopher, which is entitled
<i>On the Five Words</i>. The ‘Five Words’ are <i>Genus</i>,
<i>Species</i>, <i>Difference</i>, <i>Property</i>, <i>Accident</i>. Genus and
Species are superior and inferior classes, and are stated<a id="fnanchor2-8" href="#note2-8"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>
to be capable of repeated subordination. The ‘most <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page106">106</a></span> general Genus’ is the widest class; the ‘most special
Species’ the narrowest. Between these are intermediate classes, which are Genera with regard to those
below, and Species with regard to those above them.
Thus Being is the most general Genus; under this is
Body; under Body is Living Body; under this again
Animal; under Animal is Rational Animal, or Man;
under Man are Socrates and Plato, and other individual men.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-8" href="#fnanchor2-8">2</a></span> Porphyr. <i>Isagog.</i> c. 23.</div>
<p>The <i>Difference</i> is that which is added to the genus
to make the species; thus Rational is the Difference
by which the genus Animal is made the species Man;
the Difference in this Technical sense is the ‘Specific,’
or species-making Difference<a id="fnanchor3-8" href="#note3-8"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>. It forms the Definition for the purposes of logic, and corresponds to the
‘Character’ (specific or generic) of the Natural Historians. Indeed several of them, as, for instance, Linnæus, in his <i>Philosophia Botanica</i>, always call these

<p>Of the other two words, the Property is that which
though not employed in defining the class, belongs to
every part of it<a id="fnanchor4-8" href="#note4-8"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>: it is, ‘What happens to all the
class, to it alone, and at all times; as <i>to be capable of

<p>The Accident is that which may be present and
absent without the destruction of the subject, as to
sleep is an Accident (a thing which happens) to man.</p>
<p>I need not dwell further on this system of technicalities. The most remarkable points in it are those
which I have already noticed; the doctrine of the
successive Subordination of genera, and the fixing
attention upon the Specific Difference. These doctrines,
though invented in order to make reasoning more systematic, and at a period anterior to the existence of
any Classificatory Science, have, by a curious contrast
with the intentions of their founders, been of scarcely <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page107">107</a></span> any use in sciences of <i>Reasoning</i>, but have been amply
applied and developed in the <i>Natural History</i> which
arose in later times.</p>
<p>We must now treat of the principles on which this
science (Natural History) proceeds, and explain what
peculiar and technical processes it employs in addition
to those of common thought and common language.</p>

<span class="sc">The Methods of Natural History, as regulated by the Idea of Likeness.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> I.&#8212;<i>Natural History in general.</i></h4>
<p id="b8c2s1">1. <i>Idea of Likeness in Natural History.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">The</span>
various branches of Natural History, in so far as they
are classificatory sciences merely, and do not depend
upon physiological views, rest upon the same Idea of
Likeness which is the ground of the application of the
names, more or less general, of common language. But
the nature of science requires that, for her purposes,
this Idea should be applied in a more exact and rigourous manner than in its common and popular employment; just as occurs with regard to the other Ideas
on which science is founded;&#8212;for instance, as the idea
of space gives rise, in popular use, to the relations
implied in the prepositions and adjectives which refer
to position and form, and in its scientific development gives rise to the more precise relations of geometry.</p>
<p>The way in which the Idea of Likeness has been
applied, so as to lead to the construction of a science,
is best seen in Botany: for, in the Classification of
Animals, we are inevitably guided by a consideration
of the <i>function</i> of parts; that is, by an idea of <em>purpose</em>,
and not of likeness merely: and in Mineralogy, the
attempts at classification on the principles of Natural
History have been hitherto very imperfectly successful. But in Botany we have an example of a branch
of knowledge in which systematic classification has
been effected with great beauty and advantage; and
in which the peculiarities and principles on which such <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page109">109</a></span> classification must depend have been carefully studied.
Many of the principal botanists, as Linnæus, Adanson,
Decandolle, have not only practically applied, but have
theoretically enunciated, what they held to be the
sound maxims of classificatory science: and have thus
enabled us to place before the reader with confidence
the philosophy of this kind of science.</p>
<p id="b8c2s2">2. <i>Condition of its Use.</i>&#8212;We may begin by remarking that the Idea of Likeness, in its systematic employment, is governed by the same principle which we
have already spoken of as regulating the distribution
of things into kinds, and the assignment of names in
unsystematic thought and speech; namely, the condition that <em>general propositions shall be possible</em>. But as
in this case the propositions are to be of a scientific
form and exactness, the likeness must be treated with
a corresponding precision; and its consequences traced
by steady and distinct processes. Naturalists must,
for their purposes, employ the resemblances of objects
in a technical manner. This technical process may be
considered as consisting of three steps;&#8212;The fixation
of the resemblances; The use of them in making a
classification; The means of applying the classification.
These three steps may be spoken of as the <i>Terminology</i>,
the <i>Plan of the System</i>, and the <i>Scheme of the Characters</i>.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.&#8212;<i>Terminology.</i><a id="fnanchor5-8" href="#note5-8"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a></h4>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-8" href="#fnanchor5-8">5</a></span> Decandolle and others use the
term <i>Glossology</i> instead of Terminology, to avoid the blemish of a word
compounded of two parts taken from
different languages. The convenience
of treating the termination <i>ology</i> (and
a few other parts of compounds) as
not restricted to Greek combinations,
is so great, that I shall venture, in
these cases, to disregard this philological scruple.</div>
<p id="b8c2s3">3. <i>Terminology</i> signifies the collection of <i>terms</i>, or
technical words, which belong to the science. But in
fixing the meaning of the terms, at least of the descriptive terms, we necessarily fix, at the same time,
the perceptions and notions which the terms are to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page110">110</a></span> convey; and thus the Terminology of a classificatory
science exhibits the elements of its substance as well
as of its language. A large but indispensable part of
the study of botany (and of mineralogy and zoology
also,) consists in the acquisition of the peculiar vocabulary of the science.</p>
<p>The meaning of technical terms can be fixed in the
first instance only by convention, and can be made
intelligible only by presenting to the senses that which
the terms are to signify. The knowledge of a colour
by its name can only be taught through the eye. No
description can convey to a hearer what we mean by
<i>apple-green</i> or <i>French grey</i>. It might, perhaps, be
supposed that, in the first example, the term <i>apple</i>,
referring to so familiar an object, sufficiently suggests
the colour intended. But it may easily be seen that
this is not true; for apples are of many different hues
of green, and it is only by a conventional selection that
we can appropriate the term to one special shade.
When this appropriation is once made, the term refers
to the sensation, and not to the parts of this term; for
these enter into the compound merely as a help to the
memory, whether the suggestion be a natural connexion as in ‘apple-green,’ or a casual one as in
‘French grey.’ In order to derive due advantage
from technical terms of this kind, they must be associated <em>immediately</em> with the perception to which they
belong; and not connected with it through the vague
usages of common language. The memory must retain
the sensation; and the technical word must be understood as directly as the most familiar word, and more
distinctly. When we find such terms as <i>tin-white</i> or
<i>pinchbeck-brown</i>, the metallic colour so denoted ought
to start up in our memory without delay or search.</p>
<p>This, which it is most important to recollect with
respect to the simpler properties of bodies, as colour
and form, is no less true with respect to more compound notions. In all cases the term is fixed to a
peculiar meaning by convention; and the student, in
order to use the word, must be completely familiar
with the convention, so that he has no need to frame <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page111">111</a></span> conjectures from the word itself. Such conjectures
would always be insecure, and often erroneous. Thus
the term <i>papilionaceous</i>, applied to a flower, is employed to indicate, not only a resemblance to a butterfly, but a resemblance arising from five petals of a
certain peculiar shape and arrangement; and even if
the resemblance to a butterfly were much stronger than
it is in such cases, yet if it were produced in a different way, as, for example, by one petal, or two only,
instead of a ‘standard,’ two ‘wings,’ and a ‘keel’
consisting of two parts more or less united into one,
we should no longer be justified in speaking of it as a
‘papilionaceous’ flower.</p>
<p>The formation of an exact and extensive descriptive
language for botany has been executed with a degree
of skill and felicity, which, before it was attained,
could hardly have been dreamt of as attainable. Every
part of a plant has been named; and the form of every
part, even the most minute, has had a large assemblage
of descriptive terms appropriated to it, by means of
which the botanist can convey and receive knowledge
of form and structure, as exactly as if each minute
part were presented to him vastly magnified. This
acquisition was part of the Linnæan Reform, of which
we have spoken in the <i>History</i>. ‘Tournefort,’ says
Decandolle<a id="fnanchor6-8" href="#note6-8"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>, ‘appears to have been the first who really
perceived the utility of fixing the sense of terms in
such a way as always to employ the same word in the
same sense, and always to express the same idea by
the same word; but it was Linnæus who really created
and fixed this botanical language, and this is his fairest
claim to glory, for by this fixation of language he
has shed clearness and precision over all parts of the
science.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-8" href="#fnanchor6-8">6</a></span> <i>Theor. Elem.</i> p. 327.</div>
<p>It is not necessary here to give any detailed account
of the terms of botany. The fundamental ones have
been gradually introduced, as the parts of plants were
more carefully and minutely examined. Thus the
flower was successively distinguished into the <i>calyx</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page112">112</a></span> the <i>corolla</i>, the <i>stamens</i>, and the <i>pistils</i>: the sections
of the corolla were termed <i>petals</i> by Columna; those
of the calyx were called <i>sepals</i> by Necker<a id="fnanchor7-8" href="#note7-8"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>. Sometimes terms of greater generality were devised; as
<i>perianth</i> to include the calyx and corolla, whether one
or both of these were present<a id="fnanchor8-8" href="#note8-8"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>; <i>pericarp</i> for the part
inclosing the grain, of whatever kind it be, fruit, nut,
pod, &amp;c. And it may easily be imagined that descriptive terms may, by definition and combination, become
very numerous and distinct. Thus leaves may be
called <i>pinnatifid</i><a id="fnanchor9-8" href="#note9-8"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a>, <i>pinnatipartite</i>, <i>pinnatisect</i>, <i>pinnatilobate</i>, <i>palmatifid</i>, <i>palmatipartite</i>, &amp;c., and each of these
words designates different combinations of the modes
and extent of the divisions of the leaf with the divisions of its outline. In some cases arbitrary numerical
relations are introduced into the definition: thus a leaf
is called <i>bilobate</i><a id="fnanchor10-8" href="#note10-8"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> when it is divided into two parts by
a notch; but if the notch go to the middle of its
length, it is <i>bifid</i>; if it go near the base of the leaf, it
is <i>bipartite</i>; if to the base, it is <i>bisect</i>. Thus, too, a
pod of a cruciferous plant is a <i>silica</i><a id="fnanchor11-8" href="#note11-8"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> if it be four
times as long as it is broad, but if it be shorter than
this it is a <i>silicula</i>. Such terms being established, the
form of the very complex leaf or frond of a fern is
exactly conveyed by the following phrase: ‘fronds
rigid pinnate, pinnæ recurved subunilateral pinnatifid,
the segments linear undivided or bifid spinuloso-serrate<a id="fnanchor12-8" href="#note12-8"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-8" href="#fnanchor7-8">7</a></span> Decandolle, 329</div>

<p>Other characters, as well as form, are conveyed with
the like precision: Colour by means of a classified
scale of colours, as we have seen in speaking of the
Measures of Secondary Qualities; to which, however,
we must add, that the naturalist employs arbitrary
names, (such as we have already quoted,) and not mere
numerical exponents, to indicate a certain number of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page113">113</a></span> selected colours. This was done with most precision
by Werner, and his scale of colours is still the most
usual standard of naturalists. Werner also introduced
a more exact terminology with regard to other characters
which are important in mineralogy, as lustre, hardness. But Mohs improved upon this step by giving a
numerical scale of hardness, in which <i>talc</i> is 1, <i>gypsum</i>
2, <i>calc spar</i> 3, and so on, as we have already explained
in the History of Mineralogy. Some properties, as
specific gravity, by their definition give at once a
numerical measure; and others, as crystalline form,
require a very considerable array of mathematical calculation and reasoning, to point out their relations and
gradations. In all cases the features of likeness in the
objects must be rightly apprehended, in order to their
being expressed by a distinct terminology. Thus no
terms could describe crystals for any purpose of natural history, till it was discovered that in a class of
minerals the proportion of the faces might vary, while
the angle remained the same. Nor could crystals be
described so as to distinguish species, till it was found
that the derived and primitive forms are connected by
very simple relations of space and number. The discovery of the mode in which characters must be apprehended so that they may be considered as <em>fixed</em> for a
class, is an important step in the progress of each
branch of Natural History; and hence we have had,
in the History of Mineralogy and Botany, to distinguish as important and eminent persons those who
made such discoveries, Romé de Lisle and Haüy,
Cesalpinus and Gesner.</p>
<p>By the continued progress of that knowledge of
minerals, plants, and other natural objects, in which
such persons made the most distinct and marked steps,
but which has been constantly advancing in a more
gradual and imperceptible manner, the most important
and essential features of similarity and dissimilarity in
such objects have been selected, arranged, and fitted
with names; and we have thus in such departments,
systems of Terminology which fix our attention upon
the resemblances which it is proper to consider, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page114">114</a></span> enable us to convey them in words. We have now to
speak of the mode in which such resemblances have
been employed in the construction of a Systematic
Classification.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> III. <i>The Plan of the System.</i></h4>
<p id="b8c2s4">4. The collection of sound views and maxims by
which the resemblances of natural objects are applied
so as to form a scientific classification, is a department
of the philosophy of natural history which has been
termed by some writers (as Decandolle), <i>Taxonomy</i>, as
containing the <i>Laws</i> of the <i>Taxis</i> (<i>arrangement</i>).
By some Germans this has been denominated <i>Systematik</i>; if we could now form a new substantive after
the analogy of the words <i>Logick</i>, <i>Rhetorick</i>, and the
like, we might call it <i>Systematick</i>. But though our
English writers commonly use the expression <i>Systematical Botany</i> for the Botany of Classification, they
appear to prefer the term <i>Diataxis</i> for the method of
constructing the classification. The rules of such a
branch of science are curious and instructive.</p>
<p>In framing a Classification of objects we must attend
to their resemblances and differences. But here the
question occurs, to <em>what</em> resemblances and differences?
for a different selection of the points of resemblance
would give different results: a plant frequently agrees
in leaves with one group of plants, in flowers with another. Which set of characters are we to take as our
guide?</p>
<p>The view already given of the regulative principle
of all classification, namely, that it must enable us to
assert true and general propositions, will obviously
occur as applicable here. The object of a scientific
Classification is to enable us to enunciate scientific
truths: we must therefore classify according to those
resemblances of objects (plants or any others) which
bring to light such truths.</p>
<p>But this reply to the inquiry, ‘On what characters
of resemblance we are to found our system,’ is still too
general and vague to be satisfactory. It carries us, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page115">115</a></span> however, as far as this;&#8212;that since the truths we are
to attend to are scientific truths, governed by precise
and homogeneous relations, we must not found our
scientific Classification on casual, indefinite, and unconnected considerations. We must not, for instance, be
satisfied with dividing plants, as Dioscorides does, into
<i>aromatic</i>, <i>esculent</i>, <i>medicinal</i> and <i>vinous</i>; or even with
the long prevalent distribution into <i>trees</i>, <i>shrubs</i>, and
<i>herbs</i>; since in these subdivisions there is no consistent
principle.</p>
<p id="b8c2s5">5. <i>Latent Reference to Natural Affinity.</i>&#8212;But there
may be several kinds of truths, all exact and coherent,
which may be discovered concerning plants or any
other natural objects; and if this should be the case,
our rule leaves us still at a loss in what manner our
classification is to be constructed. And, historically
speaking, a much more serious inconvenience has been
this;&#8212;that the task of classification of plants was necessarily performed when the general laws of their
form and nature were very little known; or rather,
when the existence of such laws was only just beginning to be discerned. Even up to the present day,
the general propositions which botanists are able to
assert concerning the structure and properties of plants,
are extremely imperfect and obscure.</p>
<p>We are thus led to this conclusion:&#8212;that the Idea
of Likeness could not be applied so as to give rise to a
scientific Classification of plants, till considerable progress was made in studying the general relations of
vegetable form and life; and that the selection of the
resemblances which should be taken into account,
must depend upon the nature of the relations which
were then brought into view.</p>
<p>But this amounts to saying that, in the consideration of the Classification of vegetables, other Ideas
must be called into action as well as the Idea of Likeness. The additional general views to which the
more intimate study of plants leads, must depend,
like all general truths, upon some regulating Idea
which gives unity to scattered facts. No progress
could be made in botanical knowledge without the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page116">116</a></span> operation of such principles: and such additional Ideas
must be employed, besides those of mere likeness and
unlikeness, in order to point out that Classification
which has a real scientific value.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the classificatory sciences, Ideas
other than Likeness do make their appearance. Such
Ideas in botany have influenced the progress of the
science, even before they have been clearly brought
into view. We have especially the Idea of Affinity,
which is the basis of all Natural Systems of Classification, and which we shall consider in a succeeding
<a href="#v2page159">chapter</a>. The assumption that there <em>is</em> a Natural System, an assumption made by all philosophical botanists,
implies a belief in the existence of Natural Affinity,
and is carried into effect by means of principles which
are involved in that Idea. But as the formation of all
systems of classification must involve, in a great degree, the Idea of Resemblance and Difference, I shall
first consider the effect of that Idea, before I treat
specially of Natural Affinity.</p>
<p id="b8c2s6">6. <i>Natural Classes.</i>&#8212;Many attempts were made to
classify vegetables before the rules which govern a
natural system were clearly apprehended. Botanists
agree in esteeming some characters as of more value
than others, before they had agreed upon any general
rules or principles for estimating the relative importance of the characters. They were convinced of the
necessity of adding other considerations to that of Resemblance, without seeing clearly what these others
ought to be. They aimed at a Natural Classification,
without knowing distinctly in what manner it was to
be Natural.</p>
<p>The attempts to form <i>Natural Classes</i>, therefore,
in the first part of their history, belong to the Idea
of Likeness, though obscurely modified, even from an
early period, by the Ideas of Affinity, and even of
Function and of Development. Hence Natural
Classes may, to a certain extent, be treated of in this
place.</p>
<p>Natural Classes are opposed to Artificial Classes
which are understood to be regulated by an <em>assumed</em> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page117">117</a></span> character. Yet no classes can be so absolutely Artificial in this sense, as to be framed upon characters
<em>arbitrarily</em> assumed; for instance, no one would speak
of a class of shrubs defined by the circumstance of
each having a hundred leaves: for of such a class no
assertion could be made, and therefore the class could
never come under our notice. In what sense then are
Artificial Classes to be understood, as opposed to Natural?</p>
<p id="b8c2s7">7. <i>Artificial Classes.</i>&#8212;To this question, the following is the answer. When Natural Classes of a certain
small extent have been formed, a system may be
devised which shall be regulated by a few selected characters, and which shall not dissever these small Natural Classes, but conform to them as far as they go. If
these selected characters be then made absolute and
imperative, and if we abandon all attempt to obtain
Natural Classes of any higher order and wider extent,
we form an Artificial System.</p>
<p>Thus in the Linnæan System of Botanical Classification, it is assumed that certain natural groups, namely,
Species and Genera, are established; it is conceived,
moreover, that the division of Classes according to
the number of stamens and of pistils does not violate
the natural connexions of Species and Genera. This
arrangement, according to the number of stamens and
pistils, (further modified in certain cases by other considerations,) is then made the ground of all the higher
divisions of plants, and thus we have an Artificial
System.</p>
<p>It has been objected to this view, that the Linnæan
Artificial System does not in all cases respect the
boundaries of genera, but would, if rigorously applied,
distribute the species of the same genus into different
artificial classes; it would divide, for instance, the
genera <i>Valeriana</i>, <i>Geranium</i><a id="fnanchor13-8" href="#note13-8"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>, &amp;c. To this we must
reply, that so far as the Linnæan System does this, it
is an imperfect Artificial System. Its great merit is
in its making such a disjunction in comparatively so <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page118">118</a></span> few cases; and in the artificial characters being, for
the most part, obvious and easily applied.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-8" href="#fnanchor13-8">13</a></span> Decand. <i>Theor. Elem.</i> p. 45.</div>
<p id="b8c2s8">8. <i>Are Genera Natural</i>?&#8212;It has been objected also
that Genera are not Natural groups. Linnæus asserts
in the most positive manner that they are<a id="fnanchor14-8" href="#note14-8"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>. On which
Adanson observes<a id="fnanchor15-8" href="#note15-8"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>, ‘I know not how any Botanist can
maintain such a thesis: that which is certain is, that
up to the present time no one has been able to prove
it, nor to give an exact definition of a natural genus,
but only of an artificial.’ He then brings several
arguments to confirm this view.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-8" href="#fnanchor14-8">14</a></span>  <i>Phil. Bot.</i> Art. 165.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-8" href="#fnanchor15-8">15</a></span> <i>Famille de Ph.</i> Pref. cv.</div>
<p>But we are to observe, in answer to this, that
Adanson improperly confounds the recognition of the
existence of a natural group with the invention of a
technical mark or definition of it. Genera are groups
of species associated in virtue of natural affinity, of
general resemblance, of real propinquity: of such
groups, certain selected characters, one or few, may
usually be discovered, by which the species may be
referred to their groups. These Artificial characters
do not constitute, but indicate the genus: they are the
<em>Diagnosis</em>, not the basis of the <em>Diataxis</em>: and they are
always subject to be rejected, and to have others substituted for them, when they violate the natural connexion of species which a minute and enlarged study
discovers.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, no proof that Genera are not Natural, to say that their artificial characters are different
in different systems. Such characters are only different
attempts to confine the variety of nature within the
limits of definition. Nor is it sufficient to say that
these groups themselves are different in different writers; that some botanists make genera what others
make only species; as <i>Pedicularis</i>, <i>Rhinanthus</i>, <i>Euphrasia</i>, <i>Antirrhinum</i><a id="fnanchor16-8" href="#note16-8"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>. This discrepancy shows only
that the natural arrangement is not yet completely
known, even in the smaller groups; a conclusion to
which we need not refuse our assent. But in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page119">119</a></span> opposition to these negatives, the manner in which Genera
have been established proves that they are regulated
by the principle of being natural, and by that alone.
For they are not formed according to any <i>à priori</i>
rule. The Botanist does not take any selected or
arbitrary part or parts of the plants, and marshal his
genera according to the differences of this part. On
the contrary, the divisions of genera are sometimes
made by means of the flower; sometimes by means of
the fruit: the anthers, the stamens, the seeds, the
pericarp, and the most varied features of these parts,
are used in the most miscellaneous and unsystematic
manner. Linnæus has indeed laid down a maxim that
the characteristic differences of genera must reside in
the fructification<a id="fnanchor17-8" href="#note17-8"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>: but Adanson has justly remarked<a id="fnanchor18-8" href="#note18-8"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>,
that an arbitrary restriction like this makes the groups
artificial: and that in some families other characters
are more essential than those of the fructification; as
the leaves in the families of <i>Aparineæ</i> and <i>Leguminosæ</i>,
and the disposition of the flowers in <i>Labiatæ</i>. And
Naturalists are so far from thinking it sufficient to
distribute species into genera by <em>arbitrary</em> marks, that
we find them in many cases lamenting the absence of
good <em>natural</em> marks: as in the families of <i>Umbelliferæ</i>,
where Linnæus declared that any one who could find
good characters of genera would deserve great admiration, and where it is only of late that good characters

means principally of the ribs of the fruit<a id="fnanchor20-8" href="#note20-8"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-8" href="#fnanchor20-8">20</a></span> In like manner we find Cuvier saying of Rondelet that he has ‘un <em>sentiment</em> très vrai des genres.’ <i>Hist. Ichth.</i> p. 39.</div>
<p>It is thus clear that Genera are not established on
any assumed or preconceived basis. What, then, is
the principle which regulates botanists when they try
to fix genera? What is the arrangement which they
thus wish for, without being able to hit upon it?
What is the tendency which thus drives them from
the corolla to the anthers, from the flower to the fruit, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page120">120</a></span> from the fructification to the leaves? It is plain that
they seek something, not of their own devising and
creating;&#8212;not anything merely conventional and systematic; but something which they conceive to exist
in the relations of the plants themselves;&#8212;something
which is without the mind, not within;&#8212;in nature,
not in art;&#8212;in short, a Natural Order.</p>
<p>Thus the regulative principle of a Genus, or of any
other natural group is, that it is, or is supposed to be,
natural. And by reference to this principle as our
guide, we shall be able to understand the meaning of
that indefiniteness and indecision which we frequently
find in the descriptions of such groups, and which
must appear so strange and inconsistent to any one
who does not suppose these descriptions to assume any
deeper ground of connexion than an arbitrary choice
of the botanist. Thus in the family of the Rose-tree,
we are told that the <i>ovules</i> are <em>very rarely</em> erect<a id="fnanchor21-8" href="#note21-8"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>, the
<i>stigmata</i> are <em>usually</em> simple. Of what use, it might
be asked, can such loose accounts be? To which the
answer is, that they are not inserted in order to distinguish the species, but in order to describe the family,
and the total relations of the ovules and of the stigmata of the family are better known by this general
statement. A similar observation may be made with
regard to the Anomalies of each group, which occur so
commonly, that Mr. Lindley, in his <i>Introduction to the
Natural System of Botany</i>, makes the ‘Anomalies’ an
article in each Family. Thus, part of the character of
the Rosaceæ is that they have alternate <i>stipulate</i> leaves,
and that the <i>albumen</i> is <i>obliterated</i>: but yet in <i>Lowea</i>,
one of the genera of this family, the stipulæ are <em>absent</em>;
and the albumen is <em>present</em> in another, <i>Neillia</i>. This
implies, as we have already seen, that the artificial
character (or <i>diagnosis</i> as Mr. Lindley calls it) is imperfect. It is, though very nearly, yet not exactly,
commensurate with the natural group: and hence, in
certain cases, this character is made to yield to the
general weight of natural affinities.</p>

<p id="b8c2s9"><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page121">121</a></span> 9. <i>Difference of Natural History and Mathematics.</i>&#8212;These views,&#8212;of classes determined by characters
which cannot be expressed in words,&#8212;of propositions
which state, not what happens in all cases, but only
usually,&#8212;of particulars which are included in a class
though they transgress the definition of it, may very
probably surprise the reader. They are so contrary to
many of the received opinions respecting the use of
definitions and the nature of scientific propositions,
that they will probably appear to many persons highly
illogical and unphilosophical. But a disposition to
such a judgment arises in a great measure from this;&#8212;that the mathematical and mathematico-physical
sciences have, in a great degree, determined men’s
views of the general nature and form of scientific truth;
while Natural History has not yet had time or opportunity to exert its due influence upon the current
habits of philosophizing. The apparent indefiniteness
and inconsistency of the classifications and definitions
of Natural History belongs, in a far higher degree, to
all other except mathematical speculations: and the
modes in which approximations to exact distinctions
and general truths have been made in Natural History, may be worthy our attention, even for the light
they throw upon the best modes of pursuing truth of
all kinds.</p>
<p id="b8c2s10">10. <i>Natural Groups given by Type not by Definition.</i>&#8212;The further development of this suggestion must
be considered hereafter. But we may here observe,
that though in a Natural Group of objects a definition
can no longer be of any use as a regulative principle,
classes are not, therefore, left quite loose, without any
certain standard or guide. The class is steadily fixed,
though not precisely limited; it is given, though not
circumscribed; it is determined, not by a boundary
line without, but by a central point within; not by
what it strictly excludes, but by what it eminently
includes; by an example, not by a precept; in short,
instead of Definition we have a <em>Type</em> for our director.</p>
<p>A Type is an example of any class, for instance, a
species of a genus, which is considered as eminently <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page122">122</a></span> possessing the characters of the class. All the species
which have a greater affinity with this Type-species
than with any others, form the genus, and are ranged
about it, deviating from it in various directions and
different degrees. Thus a genus may consist of several
species, which approach very near the type, and of
which the claim to a place with it is obvious; while
there may be other species which straggle further from
this central knot, and which yet are clearly more connected with it than with any other. And even if
there should be some species of which the place is
dubious, and which appear to be equally bound by two
generic types, it is easily seen that this would not
destroy the reality of the generic groups, any more
than the scattered trees of the intervening plain prevent our speaking intelligibly of the distinct forests of
two separate hills.</p>
<p>The Type-species of every genus, the Type-genus of
every family, is, then, one which possesses all the characters and properties of the genus in a marked and
prominent manner. The Type of the Rose family has
alternate stipulate leaves, wants the albumen, has the
ovules not erect, has the stigmata simple, and besides
these features, which distinguish it from the exceptions
or varieties of its class, it has the features which
make it prominent in its class. It is one of those
which possess clearly several leading attributes; and
thus, though we cannot say of any one genus that it
<em>must</em> be the Type of the family, or of any one species
that it <em>must</em> be the Type of the genus, we are still not
wholly to seek: the Type must be connected by
many affinities with most of the others of its group; it
must be near the center of the crowd, and not one of
the stragglers.</p>
<p id="b8c2s11">11. It has already been repeatedly stated, as the
great rule of all classification, that the classification
must serve to assert general propositions. It may be
asked <em>what</em> propositions we are able to enunciate by
means of such classifications as we are now treating of.
And the answer is, that the collected knowledge of the
characters, habits, properties, organization, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page123">123</a></span> functions of these groups and families, as it is found in the
best botanical works, and as it exists in the minds of
the best botanists, exhibits to us the propositions which
constitute the science, and to the expression of which
the classification is to serve. All that is not strictly
definition, that is, all that is not artificial character,
in the descriptions of such classes, is a statement of
truths, more or less general, more or less precise, but
making up, together, the positive knowledge which
constitutes the science. As we have said, the consideration of the properties of plants in order to form
a system of classification, has been termed Taxonomy,
or the Systematick of Botany; all the parts of the
descriptions, which, taking the system for granted,
convey additional information, are termed the <i>Physiography</i> of the science; and the same terms may be
applied in the other branches of Natural History.</p>
<p id="b8c2s12">12. <i>Artificial and Natural Systems.</i>&#8212;If I have succeeded in making it apparent that an artificial system
of characters necessarily implies natural classes which
are not severed by the artificial marks, we shall now
be able to compare the nature and objects of the Artificial and Natural Systems; points on which much has
been written in recent times.</p>
<p>The Artificial System is one which is, or professes
to be, entirely founded upon marks selected according
to the condition which has been stated, of not violating
certain narrow natural groups; namely in the Linnæan system, the natural genera of plants. The marks
which form the basis of the system, being thus selected,
are applied rigorously and universally without any
further regard to any other characters or indications of
affinity. Thus in the Linnæan system, which depends
mainly on the number of male organs or stamens,
and on the number of female organs or styles, the
largest divisions, or the Classes, are arranged according
to the number of the stamens, and are <i>monandria</i>,
<i>diandria</i>, <i>triandria</i>, <i>tetrandria</i>, <i>pentandria</i>, <i>hexandria</i>,
and so on: the names being formed of the Greek numerical words, and of the word which implies <i>male</i>.
And the Orders of each of these Classes are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page124">124</a></span> distinguished by the number of styles, and are called <i>monogynia</i>, <i>digynia</i>, <i>trigynia</i>, and so on, the termination of
these words meaning <i>female</i>. And so far as this numerical division and subdivision go on, the system is a
rigorous system, and strictly artificial.</p>
<p>But the condition that the artificial system shall leave
certain natural affinities untouched, makes it impossible
to go through the vegetable kingdom by a method of
mere numeration of stamens and styles. The distinction
of flowers with twenty and with thirty stamens is not a
fixed distinction: flowers of one and the same kind, as
roses, have, some fewer than the former, some more
than the latter number. The Artificial System, therefore, must be modified. And there are various relations of connexion and proportion among the stamina
which are more permanent and important than their
mere number. Thus flowers with two longer and two
shorter stamens are not placed in the class <i>tetrandria</i>,
but are made a separate class <i>didynamia</i>; those with
four longer and two shorter are in like manner <i>tetradynamia</i>, not <i>hexandria</i>; those in <span class="correction" title="emended from wich">which</span> the filaments
are bound into two bundles are <i>diadelphia</i>. All these
and other classes are deviations from the plan of the
earlier Classes, and are so far defects of the artificial
system; but they are deviations requisite in order that
the system may leave a basis of natural groups, without which it would not be a System of <i>Vegetables</i>.
And as the division is still founded on some properties
of the stamens, it combines not ill with that part of
the system which depends on the number of them.
The Classes framed in virtue of these various considerations make up an Artificial System which is tolerably
coherent.</p>
<p>‘But since the Artificial System thus regards natural groups, in what does it differ from a Natural System?’ It differs in this:&#8212;That though it allows certain subordinate natural groups, it merely allows <em>these</em>,
and does not endeavour to ascend to any wider
natural groups. It takes all the <em>higher</em> divisions of its
scheme from its artificial characters, its stamens and
pistils, without looking to any natural affinities. It <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page125">125</a></span> accepts natural <i>Genera</i>, but it does not seek natural
<i>Families</i>, or Orders, or Classes. It <em>assumes</em> natural
groups, but does not <em>investigate</em> any; it forms wider
and higher groups, but professes to frame them arbitrarily.</p>
<p>But then, on the other hand, the question occurs,
‘This being the case, what can be the use of the Artificial System?’ If its characters, in the higher stages
of classification, be arbitrary, how can it lead us to the
natural relations of plants? And the answer is, that
it does so in virtue of the original condition, that
there shall be certain natural relations which the artificial system shall not transgress; and that its use
arises from the facility with which we can follow the
artificial arrangement as far as it goes. We can count
the stamens and pistils, and thus we know the Class
and Order of our plant; and we have then to discover
its Genus and Species by means less symmetrical but
more natural. The Artificial System, though arbitrary in a certain degree, brings us to a Class in which
the whole of each Genus is contained, and there we
can find the proper Genus by a suitable method of
seeking. No Artificial System can conduct us into
the extreme of detail, but it can place us in a situation
where the detail is within our reach. We cannot find
the house of a foreign friend by its latitude and longitude; but we may be enabled, by a knowledge of the
latitude and longitude, to find the city in which he
dwells, or at least the island; and we then can reach
his abode by following the road or exploring the
locality. The Artificial System is such a method of
travelling by latitude and longitude; the Natural
System is that which is guided by a knowledge of the
country.</p>
<p>The Natural System, then, is that which endeavours
to arrange by the natural affinities of objects; and
more especially, which attempts to ascend from the
lower natural groups to the higher; as for example
from genera to natural families, orders, and classes.
But as we have already hinted, these expressions of
natural affinities, natural groups, and the like, when <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page126">126</a></span> considered in reference to the idea of resemblance
alone, without studying analogy or function, are very
vague and obscure. We must notice some of the
attempts which were made under the operation of this
imperfect view of the subject.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> IV.&#8212;<i>Modes of framing Natural Systems.</i></h4>
<p id="b8c2s13">13. Decandolle<a id="fnanchor22-8" href="#note22-8"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> distinguishes the attempts at Natural Classifications into three sorts: those of <i>blind
trial</i> (<i>tâtonnement</i>), those of <i>general comparison</i>, and
those of <i>subordination of characters</i>. The two former
do not depend distinctly upon any principle, except
resemblance; the third refers us to other views, and
must be considered in a future <a href="#v2page159">chapter</a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-8" href="#fnanchor22-8">22</a></span> <i>Theor. Elem.</i> art 41.</div>
<p><i>Method of Blind Trial.</i>&#8212;The notion of the existence of natural classes dependent on the general resemblance of plants,&#8212;of an affinity showing itself in
different parts and various ways,&#8212;though necessarily
somewhat vague and obscure, was acted upon at an
early period, as we have seen in the formation of
genera; and was enunciated in general terms soon
after. Thus Magnolius<a id="fnanchor23-8" href="#note23-8"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> says that he discerns in plants
an affinity, by means of which they may be arranged
in families: ‘Yet it is impossible to obtain from the
fructification alone the Characters of these families;
and I have therefore chosen those parts of plants in
which the principal characteristic marks are found, as
the root, the stem, the flower, the seed. In some
plants there is even a certain resemblance; an affinity
which does not consist in the parts considered separately, but in their totality; an affinity which may be
felt but not expressed; as we see in the families of
agrimonies and cinquefoils, which every botanist will
judge to be related, though they differ by their roots,
their leaves, their flowers, and their seeds.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-8" href="#fnanchor23-8">23</a></span> Dec. <i>Theor. Elem.</i> art. 42. Petri Magnoli, <i>Prodromus Hist. Gen. Plant.</i>
1689.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page127">127</a></span> This obscure feeling of a resemblance on the whole,
an affinity of an indefinite kind, appears fifty years
later in Linnæus’s attempts. ‘In the Natural Classification,’ he says<a id="fnanchor24-8" href="#note24-8"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>, ‘no <i>à priori</i> rule can be admitted,
no part of the fructification can be taken exclusively
into consideration; but only the simple symmetry of
all its parts.’ Hence though he proposed Natural
Families, and even stated the formation of such Families to be the first and last object of all Methods, he
never gave the Characters of those groups, or connected them by any method. He even declared it to
be impossible to lay down such a system of characters.
This persuasion was the result of his having refused to
admit into his mind any Idea more profound than that
notion of Resemblance of which he had made so much
and such successful use; he would not attempt to unravel the Ideas of Symmetry and of Function on which
the clear establishment of natural relations must depend. He even despised the study of the inner organization of plants; and reckoned<a id="fnanchor25-8" href="#note25-8"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> the <i>Anatomici</i>, who
studied the anatomy and physiology of plants and the
laws of vegetation, among the <i>Botanophili</i>, the mere
amateurs of his science.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-8" href="#fnanchor25-8">25</a></span> <i>Phil. Bot.</i> s. 44.</div>
<p>The same notion of general resemblance and affinity,
accompanied with the same vagueness, is to be found
in the writer who least participated in the general
admiration of Linnæus, Buffon. Though it was in a
great measure his love of higher views which made
him dislike what he considered the pedantry of the
Swedish school, he does not seem to have obtained a
clearer sight of the principle of the natural method
than his rival, except that he did not restrict his
Characters to the fructification. Things must be arranged by their resemblances and differences, (he says
in 1750<a id="fnanchor26-8" href="#note26-8"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>,) ‘but the resemblances and differences must
be taken not from one part but from the whole; and
we must attend to the form, the size, the habit, the
number and position of the parts, even the substance <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page128">128</a></span> of the part; and we must make use of these elements
in greater or smaller number, as we have need.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-8" href="#fnanchor26-8">26</a></span> Adanson, p. clvi. Buffon, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> t. i. p. 21.</div>
<p id="b8c2s14">14. <i>Method of General Comparison.</i>&#8212;A countryman of Buffon, who shared with him his depreciating
estimate of the Linnæan system, and his wish to found
a natural system upon a broader basis, was Adanson;
and he invented an ingenious method of apparently
avoiding the vagueness of the practice of following the
general feeling of resemblance. This method consisted
in making many Artificial Systems, in each of which
plants were arranged by some one part; and then collecting those plants which came near each other in the
greatest number of those Artificial Systems, as plants
naturally the most related. Adanson gives an account<a id="fnanchor27-8" href="#note27-8"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>
of the manner in which this system arose in his mind.
He had gone to Senegal, animated by an intense zeal
for natural history; and there, amid the luxuriant
vegetation of the torrid zone, he found that the methods
of Linnæus and Tournefort failed him altogether as
means of arranging his new botanical treasures. He
was driven to seek a new system. ‘For this purpose,’
he says, ‘I examined plants in all their parts, without
omitting any, from the roots to the embryo, the folding
of the leaves in the bud, their mode of sheathing<a id="fnanchor28-8" href="#note28-8"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a>, the
situation and folding of the embryo and of its radicle
in the seed, relatively to the fruit; in short, a number
of particulars which few botanists notice. I made in
the first place a complete description of each plant,
putting each of its parts in separate articles, in all its
details; when new species occurred I put down the
points in which they differed, omitting those in which
they agreed. By means of the aggregate of these comparative descriptions, I perceived that plants arranged
themselves into classes or families which could not be
artificial or arbitrary, not being founded upon one or
two parts, which might change at certain limits, but
on all the parts; so that the disproportion of one of
these parts was corrected and balanced by the introduction of another.’ Thus the principle of Resemblance <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page129">129</a></span> was to suffice for the general arrangement, not by
means of a new principle, as Symmetry or Organization, which should regulate its application, but by a
numeration of the peculiarities in which the resemblance consisted.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-8" href="#fnanchor27-8">27</a></span> Pref. p. clvii.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-8" href="#fnanchor28-8">28</a></span> ‘Leur manière de s’engainer.’</div>
<p>The labour which Adanson underwent in the execution of this thought was immense. By taking each
Organ, and considering its situation, figure, number,
&amp;c., he framed sixty-five Artificial Systems; and collected his Natural Families by a numerical combination of these. For example, his <i>sixty-fifth</i> Artificial
System<a id="fnanchor29-8" href="#note29-8"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a> is that which depends upon the situation of
the Ovary with regard to the Flower; according to
this system he frames <i>ten</i> Artificial Classes, including
<i>ninety-three</i> Sections: and of these Sections the resulting Natural Arrangement retains <i>thirty-five</i>, above
one-third: the same estimate is applied in other cases.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-8" href="#fnanchor29-8">29</a></span> Adanson, Pref. p. cccxii.</div>
<p>But this attempt to make Number supply the defects which the vague notion of Resemblance introduces, however ingenious, must end in failure. For,
as Decandolle observes<a id="fnanchor30-8" href="#note30-8"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a>, it supposes that we know,
not only all the Organs of plants, but all the points of
view in which it is possible to consider them; and
even if this assumption were true, which it is not, and
must long be very far from being, the principle is
altogether vicious; for it supposes that all these points
of view, and all the resulting artificial systems are of
equal importance:&#8212;a supposition manifestly erroneous.
We are thus led back to the consideration of the <em>Relative Importance</em> of Organs and their qualities, as a
basis for the classification of plants, which no Artificial
Method can supersede; and thus we find the necessity
of attending to something besides mere external and
detached Resemblance. The method of General Comparison cannot, any more than the method of Blind
Trial, lead us, with any certainty or clearness, to the
Natural Method. Adanson’s Families are held by
the best botanists to be, for the greater part, Natural;
but his hypotheses are unfounded; and his success is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page130">130</a></span> probably more due to the dim feeling of Affinity, by
which he was unconsciously guided, than to the help
he derived from his numerical processes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-8" href="#fnanchor30-8">30</a></span> Dec. <i>Theor. Elem.</i> p. 67.</div>
<p>In a succeeding <a href="#v2page159">chapter</a> I shall treat of that Natural Affinity on which a Natural System must really be
founded. But before proceeding to this higher subject, we must say a few words on some of the other
parts of the philosophy of Natural History,&#8212;the Gradation of Groups, the Nomenclature, the Diagnosis,
and the application of the methods to other subjects.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> V.&#8212;<i>Gradation of Groups.</i></h4>
<p id="b8c2s15">15. It has been already noticed (last <a href="#b8c1s8">chapter</a>,) that
even that vague application of the idea of resemblance
which gives rise to the terms of common language, introduces a subordination of classes, as <i>man</i>, <i>animal</i>,
<i>body</i>, <i>substance</i>. Such a subordination appears in a
more precise form when we employ this idea in a
scientific manner as we do in Natural History. We
have then a series of divisions, each inclusive of the
lower ones, which are expressed by various metaphors
in different writers. Thus some have gone as far as
eight terms of the series<a id="fnanchor31-8" href="#note31-8"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a>, and have taken, for the
most part, military names for them; as <i>Hosts</i>, <i>Legions</i>,
<i>Phalanxes</i>, <i>Centuries</i>, <i>Cohorts</i>, <i>Sections</i>, <i>Genera</i>, <i>Species</i>. But the most received series is <i>Classes</i>, <i>Orders</i>,
<i>Genera</i>, and <i>Species</i>; in which, however, we often have
other terms interpolated, as <i>Sub-genera</i>, or Sections of
genera. The expressions <i>Family</i> and <i>Tribe</i>, are commonly appropriated to natural groups; and we speak
of the Vegetable, Animal, Mineral <i>Kingdom</i>; but the
other metaphors of Provinces, Districts, &amp;c., which
this suggests, have not been commonly used<a id="fnanchor32-8" href="#note32-8"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note31-8" href="#fnanchor31-8">31</a></span> Adanson, p. cvi.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note32-8" href="#fnanchor32-8">32</a></span>  <i>Sub-Kingdom</i> has recently been employed by some naturalists.</div>
<p>It will of course be understood that each ascending
step of classification is deduced by the same process
from the one below. A Genus is a collection of Species which resemble each other more than they <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page131">131</a></span> resemble other species; an Order is a collection of Genera
having, in like manner, the first degree of resemblance,
and so on. How close or how wide the Degrees of
Resemblance are, must depend upon the nature of the
objects compared, and cannot possibly be prescribed
beforehand. Hence the same term, <i>Class</i> and <i>Order</i>
for instance, may imply, in different provinces of
nature, very different degrees of resemblance. The
Classes of Animals are Insects, Birds, Fish, Beasts,
&amp;c. The Orders of Beasts are <i>Ruminants</i>, <i>Tardigrades</i>, <i>Plantigrades</i>, &amp;c. The two Classes of Plants
(according to the Natural Order<a id="fnanchor33-8" href="#note33-8"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a>) are <i>Vascular</i> and
<i>Cellular</i>, the latter having neither sexes, flowers, nor
spiral vessels. The Vascular Plants are divided into
Orders, as <i>Umbelliferæ</i>, <i>Ranunculaceæ</i>, &amp;c.; but between this Class and its Orders are interposed two
other steps:&#8212;two Sub-classes, <i>Dicotyledonous</i> and <i>Monocotyledonous</i>, and two Tribes of each: <i>Angiospermiæ</i>,
<i>Gymnospermiæ</i> of the first; and <i>Petaloideæ</i>, <i>Glumaciæ</i>
of the second. Such interpolations are modifications
of the general formula of subordination, for the purpose
of accommodating it to the most prominent natural
affinities.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-8" href="#fnanchor33-8">33</a></span> Lindley.</div>
<p id="b8c2s16">16. <i>Species.</i>&#8212;As we have already seen in tracing
the principles of the Natural Method, when by the
intimate study of plants we seek to give fixity and
definiteness to the notion of resemblance and affinity
on which all these divisions depend, we are led to the
study of Organization and Analogy. But we make a
reference to physiological conditions even from the
first, with regard to the lowest step of our arrangement, the <i>Species</i>; for we consider it a proof of the
impropriety of separating two Species, if it be shown
that they can by any course of propagation, culture,
and treatment, the one pass into the other. It is in
this way, for example, that it has been supposed to be
established that the common Primrose, Oxlip, Polyanthus, and Cowslip, are all the same species. Plants
which thus, in virtue of external circumstances, as soil, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page132">132</a></span> exposure, climate, exhibit differences which may disappear by changing the circumstances, are called <i>Varieties</i> of the species. And thus we cannot say that a
Species is a collection of individuals which possess the
First Degree of Resemblance; for it is clear that a
primrose resembles another primrose more than it does
a cowslip; but this resemblance only constitutes a
Variety. And we find that we must necessarily include in our conception of Species, the notion of propagation from the same stock. And thus a Species
has been well defined<a id="fnanchor34-8" href="#note34-8"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a>: ‘The collection of the individuals descended from one another, or from common
parents, and of those which resemble these as much as
these resemble each other.’ And thus the sexual doctrine
of plants, or rather the consideration of them as things
which propagate their kind, (whether by seed, shoot, or
in any other way,) is at the basis of our classifications.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-8" href="#fnanchor34-8">34</a></span> Cuv. <i>Règne Animal</i>, p. 19.</div>
<p id="b8c2s17">17. The First permanent Degree of Resemblance
among organized beings is thus that which depends on
this relation of generation, and we might expect that
the groups which are connected by this relation would
derive their names from the notion of generation. It
is curious that both in Greek and Latin languages and
in our own, the words which have this origin (γένος,
<i>genus</i>, <i>kind</i>,) do not, in the phraseology of science at
least, denote the nearest degree of relationship, but
have other terms subordinate to them, which appear
etymologically to indicate a mere resemblance of appearance (εἶδος, <i>species</i>, <i>sort</i>); and these latter terms
are appropriated to the groups resulting from propagation. Probably the reason of this is, that the former
terms (<i>genus</i>, &amp;c.) had been applied so widely and
loosely before the scientific fixation of terms, that to
confine them to what we call <i>species</i> would have been
to restrict them in a manner too unusual to be convenient.</p>
<p id="b8c2s18">18. <i>Varieties. Races.</i>&#8212;The Species, as we have
said, is the collection of individuals which resemble
each other as much as do the offspring of a common <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page133">133</a></span> stock. But within the limits of this boundary, there
are often observable differences permanent enough to
attract our notice, though capable of being obliterated
by mixture in the course of generation. Such different
groups are called <i>Varieties</i>. Thus the Primrose and
Cowslip, as has been stated above, are found to be
varieties of the same plant; the Poodle and the Greyhound are well marked varieties of the species <i>dog</i>.
Such differences are hereditary, and it may be long
doubtful whether such hereditary differences are varieties only, or different species. In such cases the term
<i>Race</i> has been applied.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> VI.&#8212;<i>Nomenclature.</i></h4>
<p id="b8c2s19">19. The Nomenclature of any branch of Natural
History is the collection of names of all its species;
which, when they become extremely numerous, requires
some artifice to make it possible to recollect or apply
them. The known species of plants, for example, were
10,000 at the time of Linnæus, and are now probably
60,000. It would be useless to endeavour to frame
and employ separate names for each of these species.</p>
<p>The division of the objects into a subordinated system of classification enables us to introduce a Nomenclature which does not require this enormous number
of names. The artifice employed to avoid this inconvenience is to name a Species by means of two (or it
might be more) steps of the successive division. Thus
in Botany, each of the genera has its name, and the
species are marked by the addition of some epithet to
the name of the genus. In this manner about 1,700
generic names, with a moderate number of specific
names, were found by Linnæus sufficient to designate
with precision all the species of vegetables known at
his time. And this <i>Binary Method</i> of Nomenclature
has been found so convenient that it has been universally adopted in every other department of the Natural
History of organized beings.</p>
<p>Many other modes of Nomenclature have been tried,
but no other has at all taken root. Linnæus himself <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page134">134</a></span> appears at first to have intended marking each species
by the Generic Name accompanied by a characteristic
Descriptive Phrase; and to have proposed the employment of a <i>trivial</i> Specific Name, as he termed it, only
as a method of occasional convenience. The use of
these <i>trivial names</i>, has, however, become universal, as
we have said, and is by many persons considered the
greatest improvement introduced at the Linnæan reform.</p>
<p>Both Linnæus and other writers (as Adanson) have
given many maxims with a view of regulating the
selection of generic and specific names. The maxims
of Linnæus were intended as much as possible to exclude barbarism and confusion, and have, upon the
whole, been generally adopted; though many of them
were objected to by his contemporaries (Adanson and
others<a id="fnanchor35-8" href="#note35-8"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a>), as capricious or unnecessary innovations.
Many of the names, introduced by Linnæus, certainly
appear fanciful enough: thus he gives the name of
<i>Bauhinia</i> to a plant with leaves in pairs, because the
Bauhins were a pair of brothers; <i>Banisteria</i> is the
name of a climbing plant, in honour of Banister, who
travelled among mountains. But such names, once
established by adequate authority, lose all their inconvenience, and easily become permanent; and hence the
reasonableness of the Linnæan rule<a id="fnanchor36-8" href="#note36-8"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a>, that as such a
perpetuation of the names of persons by the names
of plants is the only honour botanists have to bestow,
it ought to be used with care and caution.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-8" href="#fnanchor36-8">36</a></span> <i>Phil Bot.</i> s. 239.</div>
<p>The generic name must, as Linnæus says, be fixed<a id="fnanchor37-8" href="#note37-8"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a>
before we attempt to form a specific name; ‘the latter
without the former is like the clapper without the
bell.’ The name of the genus being established, the
species may be marked by adding to it ‘a single word
taken at will from any quarter;’ that is, not involving
a description or any essential property of the plant,
but a casual or arbitrary appellation<a id="fnanchor38-8" href="#note38-8"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a>. Thus the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page135">135</a></span> various species of <i>Hieracium</i><a id="fnanchor39-8" href="#note39-8"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a> are <i>Hieracium Alpinum</i>, <i>H.
Halleri</i>, <i>H. Pilosella</i>, <i>H. dubium</i>, <i>H. murorum</i>, &amp;c.
where we see how different may be the kind of origin
of the words.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-8" href="#fnanchor39-8">39</a></span> Hooker, <i>Fl. Scot.</i> 228.</div>
<p>Attempts have been made at various times to form
the name of species from those of genera in some
more symmetrical manner. Thus some have numbered the species of genus, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.; but this
method is liable to the inconveniences, first, that it
offers nothing for the memory to take hold of; and
second, that if a new species intermediate between 1
and 2, 2 and 3, &amp;c., be discovered, it cannot be put in
its place. It has also been proposed to mark the species
by altering the termination of the genus. Thus Adanson<a id="fnanchor40-8" href="#note40-8"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a>, denoting a genus by the name <i>Fonna</i> (<i>Lychnidea</i>),
conceived he might mark five of its species by altering
the last vowel, <i>Fonna</i>, <i>Fonna-e</i>, <i>Fonna-i</i>, <i>Fonna-o</i>,
<i>Fonna-u</i>; then others by <i>Fonna-ha</i>, <i>Fonna-ka</i>, and so
on. This course would be liable to the same evils
which have been noticed as belonging to the numerical method.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note40-8" href="#fnanchor40-8">40</a></span> Pref. clxxvi.</div>
<p>The names of plants (and the same is true of animals) have in common practice been binary only,
consisting of a generic and a specific name. The Class
and Order have not been admitted to form part of the
appellation of the species. Indeed it is easy to see
that a name which must be identical in so many
instances as that of an Order would be, would be felt
as superfluous and burdensome. Accordingly, Linnæus
makes it a precept<a id="fnanchor41-8" href="#note41-8"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a>, that the name of the Class and
the Order must not be expressed but understood: and
hence, he says, Royen, who took <i>Lilium</i> for the name
of a Class, rightly rejected it as a generic name, and
substituted <i>Lirium</i>, with the Greek termination.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-8" href="#fnanchor41-8">41</a></span> <i>Phil. Bot.</i> s. 215.</div>
<p>Yet we must not too peremptorily assume such
maxims as these to be universal for all classificatory
sciences. It is very possible that it may be found
advisable to use <i>three</i> terms, that of order, genus and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page136">136</a></span> species, in designating minerals, as is done in Mohs’s
nomenclature; for example, <i>Rhombohedral Calc Haloide</i>, <i>Paratomous Hal Baryte</i>.</p>
<p>It is possible also that it may be found useful in
the same science to mark some of the steps of classification by the termination. Thus it has been proposed
to confine the termination <i>ite</i> to the Order <i>Silicides</i> of
Naumann, as Apophyll<i>ite</i>, Stilb<i>ite</i>, Leuc<i>ite</i>, &amp;c., and to
use names of different form in other orders, as Talc
<i>Spar</i> for Brennerite, Pyramidal Titanium <i>Oxide</i> for
Octahedrite. Some such method appears to be the
most likely to give us a tolerable mineralogical nomenclature.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> VII.&#8212;<i>Diagnosis.</i></h4>
<p id="b8c2s20">20. German Naturalists speak of a part of the
general method which they call the <i>Characteristik</i> of
Natural History, and which is distinguished from the
<i>Systematik</i> of the science. The <i>Systematick</i> arranges
the objects by means of all their resemblances, the
<i>Characteristick</i> enables us to detect their place in the
arrangement by means of a few of their characters.
What these characters are to be, must be discovered by
observation of the groups and divisions of the system
when they are formed. To construct a collection of such
characters as shall be clear and fixed, is a useful, and
generally a difficult task; for there is usually no apparent connexion between the marks which are used in
discriminating the groups, and the nature of the groups
themselves. They are assumed only because the naturalist, extensively and exactly acquainted with the
groups and the properties of the objects which compose them, sees, by a survey of the field, that these
marks divide it properly.</p>
<p>The Characteristick has been termed by some English
Botanists the <i>Diagnosis</i> of plants; a word which we
may conveniently adopt. The Diagnosis of any genus
or species is different according to the system we follow.
Thus in the Linnæan System the Diagnosis of the Rose
is in the first place given by its Class and Order: it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page137">137</a></span> Icosandrous, and Polygynous; and then the Generic
Distinction is that the calyx is five-cleft, the tube
urceolate, including many hairy achenia, the receptacle
villous<a id="fnanchor42-8" href="#note42-8"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a>. In the Natural System the Rose-Tribe are
distinguished as being<a id="fnanchor43-8" href="#note43-8"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a> ‘Polypetalous dicotyledons,
with lateral styles, superior simple ovaria, regular
perigynous stamens, exalbuminous definite seeds, and
alternate stipulate leaves.’ And the true Roses are
further distinguished by having ‘Nuts, numerous,
hairy, terminated by the persistent lateral style and
inclosed within the fleshy tube of the calyx,’ &amp;c.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-8" href="#fnanchor42-8">42</a></span> Lindley, <i>Nat. Syst.</i> p. 149.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-8" href="#fnanchor43-8">43</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> pp. 81, 3.</div>
<p>It will be observed that in a rigorous Artificial System the <i>Systematick</i> coincides with the <i>Characteristick</i>;
the <i>Diataxis</i> with the <i>Diagnosis</i>; the reason why a
plant is put in a division is identical with the mode
by which it is known to be in the division. The Rose
is in the class <i>icosandria</i>, because it has many stamens
inserted in the calyx; and when we see such a set of
stamens we immediately know the class. But this is
not the case with the Diagnosis of Natural Families.
Thus the genera <i>Lamium</i> and <i>Galeopsis</i> (Dead Nettle
and Hemp Nettle) are each formed into a separate
group in virtue of their general resemblances and
differences, and not because the former has one tooth
on each side of the lower lip, and the latter a notch in
its upper lip, though they are distinguished by these
marks.</p>
<p>Thus so far as our Systems are natural, (which, as
we have shown, all systems to a certain extent must
be), the Characteristick is distinct both from a Natural
and an Artificial System; and is, in fact, an Artificial
Key to a Natural System. As being Artificial, it takes
as few characters as possible; as being Natural, its
characters are not selected by any general or prescribed
rule, but follow the natural affinities. The Botanists
who have made any steps in the formation of a natural
method of plants since Linnæus, have all attempted to
give a Diagnosis corresponding to the Diataxis of their
method.</p>

<p class="noind" id="b8c3s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> T</span>HE
philosophy of the Sciences of Classification has had great light thrown upon it by
discussions concerning the methods which are used in
Botany: for that science is one of the most complete
examples which can be conceived of the consistent and
successful application of the principles and ideas of
Classification; and this application has been made in
general without giving rise to any very startling paradoxes, or disclosing any insurmountable difficulties.
But the discussions concerning methods of Mineralogical Classification have been instructive for quite a
different reason: they have brought into view the
boundaries and the difficulties of the process of Classification; and have presented examples in which every
possible mode of classifying appeared to involve inextricable contradictions. I will notice some of the points
of this kind which demand our attention, referring to
the works published recently by several mineralogists.</p>
<p>In the History of Mineralogy we noticed the attempt made by Mohs and other Germans to apply to
minerals a method of arrangement similar to that
which has been so successfully employed for plants.
The survey which we have now taken of the grounds
of that method will point out some of the reasons of
the very imperfect success of this attempt. We have
already said that the <i>Terminology</i> of Mineralogy was
materially reformed by Werner; and including in this
branch of the subject (as we must do) the Crystallography of later writers, it may be considered as to a
great extent complete. Of the attempts at a Natural
arrangement, that of Mohs appears to proceed by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page139">139</a></span> method of <i>blind trial</i>, the undefinable perception of
relationship, by which the earliest attempts at a Natural Arrangement of plants were made. Breithaupt
however, has made (though I do not know that he has
published) an essay in a mode which corresponds very
nearly to Adanson’s process of <i>multiplied comparisons</i>.
Having ascertained the specific gravity and hardness
of all the species of minerals, he arranged them in a
table, representing by two lines at right angles to each
other these two numerical quantities. Thus all minerals were distributed according to two co-ordinates
representing specific gravity and hardness. He conceived that the groups which were thus brought together were natural groups. On both these methods, and
on all similar ones, we might observe, that in minerals
as in plants, the mere general notion of Likeness cannot lead us to a real arrangement: this notion requires
to have precision and aim given it by some other relation;&#8212;by the relation of Chemical Composition in
minerals, as by the relation of Organic Function in
vegetables. The physical and crystallographical properties of minerals must be studied with reference to
their constitution; and they must be arranged into
Groups which have some common Chemical Character,
before we can consider any advance as made towards a
Natural Arrangement.</p>
<p>In reality, it happens in Mineralogy as it happened
in Botany, that those speculators are regulated by
an obscure perception of this ulterior relation, who
do not profess to be regulated by it. Several of the
Orders of Mohs have really great unity of chemical
character, and thus have good evidence of their being
really Natural Orders.</p>
<p id="b8c3s2">2. Supposing the Diataxis of minerals thus obtained, Mohs attempted the Diagnosis; and his <i>Characteristick of the Mineral Kingdom</i>, published in
Dresden, in 1820, was the first public indication of his
having constructed a system. From the nature of a
Characteristick, it is necessarily brief, and without any
ostensible principle; but its importance was duly appreciated by the author’s countrymen. Since that <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page140">140</a></span> time, many attempts have been made at improved
arrangements of minerals, but none, I think, (except
perhaps that of Breithaupt,) professing to proceed
rigorously on the principles of Natural History;&#8212;to
arrange by means of external characters, neglecting
altogether, or rather postponing, the consideration of
chemical properties. By relaxing from this rigour,
however, and by combining physical and chemical considerations, arrangements have been obtained (for
example, that of Naumann,) which appear more likely
than the one of Mohs to be approximations to an ultimate really natural system. Naumann’s Classes are
<i>Hydrolytes</i>, <i>Haloides</i>, <i>Silicides</i>, <i>Metal Oxides</i>, <i>Metals</i>,
<i>Sulphurides</i>, <i>Anthracides</i>, with subdivisions of Orders,
as <i>Anhydrous unmetallic Silicides</i>. It may be remarked
that the designations of these are mostly chemical. As
we have observed already, Chemistry, and Mineralogy
in its largest sense, are each the necessary supplement
of the other. If Chemistry furnish the Nomenclature,
Mineralogy must supply the Physiography: if the
Arrangement be founded on External Characters and
the Names be independent of Chemistry, the chemical
composition of each species is an important scientific
Truth respecting it.</p>
<p id="b8c3s3">3. The inquiry may actually occur, whether any
subordination of groups in the mineral kingdom has
really been made out. The ancient chemical arrangements, for instance, that of Haüy, though professing
to distribute minerals according to Classes, Orders,
Genera, and Species, were not only arbitrary, but inapplicable; for the first postulate of any method, that
the species should have constant characters of unity
and difference, was not satisfied. It was not ascertained
that carbonate of lime was really distinguishable in all
cases from carbonate of magnesia, or of iron; yet these
species were placed in remote parts of the system: and
the above carbonates made just so many species; although, if they were distinct from one another at all,
they were further distinguishable into additional species. Even now, we may, perhaps, say that the limits
of mineralogical species, and their laws of fixity, are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page141">141</a></span> not yet clearly seen. For the discoveries of the isomorphous relations and of the optical properties of
minerals have rather shown us in what direction the
object lies, than led us to the goal. It is clear that, in
the mineral kingdom, the Definition of Species, borrowed from the laws of the continuation of the kind,
which holds throughout the organic world, fails us
altogether, and must be replaced by some other condition: nor is it difficult to see that the definite atomic
relations of the chemical constituents, and the definite
crystalline angle, must supply the principles of the
<em>Specific</em> Identity for minerals. Yet the exact limits of
definiteness in both these cases (when we admit the
effect of mechanical mixtures, &amp;c.) have not yet been
completely disentangled. Moreover, any <em>arbitrary</em> assumption (as the allowance of a certain per-centage of
mixture, or a certain small deviation in the angle,) is
altogether contrary to the philosophy of the Natural
System, and can lead to no stable views. It is only
by laborious, extensive, and minute research, that we
can hope to attain to any solid basis of arrangement.</p>
<p id="b8c3s4">4. Still, though there are many doubts respecting
mineralogical species, a large number of such species
are so far fixed that they may be supposed capable of
being united under the higher divisions of a system
with approximate truth. Of these higher divisions,
those which have been termed <i>Orders</i> appear to tend
to something like a fixed chemical character. Thus
the <i>Haloids</i> of Naumann, and mostly those of Mohs,
are combinations of an oxide with an acid, and thus
resemble Salts, whence their name. The Silicides
contain most of Mohs’s <i>Spaths</i>: and the Orders <i>Pyrites</i>, <i>Glance</i>, and <i>Blende</i>, are common to Naumann
and Mohs; being established by the latter on a difference of external character, which difference is, indeed,
very manifest; and being included by the former in
one chemical <i>Class</i>, <i>Sulphurides</i>. The distinctions of
<i>Hydrous</i> and <i>Anhydrous</i>, <i>Metallic</i> and <i>Unmetallic</i>,
are, of course, chemical distinctions, but occur as the
differences of Orders in Naumann’s mixed system. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page142">142</a></span></p>
<p>We may observe that some French writers, following Haüy’s last edition, use, instead of <i>metallic</i> and
<i>unmetallic</i>, <i>autopside metallic</i> and <i>heteropside metallic</i>;
meaning by this phraseology to acknowledge the discovery that earths, etc., <em>are</em> metallic, though they do
not <em>appear</em> to be so, while metals both are and appear
metallic. But this seems to be a refinement not only
useless but absurd. For what is gained by adding the
word <i>metallic</i>, which is common to all, and therefore
makes no distinction? If certain metals are distinguished by their <em>appearing</em> to be metals, this appearance is a reason for giving them the peculiar name,
<i>metals</i>. Nothing is gained by first bringing earths and
metals together, and then immediately separating
them again by new and inconvenient names. No proposition can be expressed better by calling <i>earths</i>, <i>heteropside metallic substances</i>, and therefore such nomenclature is to be rejected.</p>
<p>Granting, then, that the Orders of the best recent
mineralogical systems approximate to natural groups,
we are led to ask whether the same can be said of the
Genera of the Natural History systems, such as those
of Mohs and Breithaupt. And here I must confess
that I see no principle in these Genera; I have failed
to apprehend the conceptions by the application of
which they have been constructed: I shall therefore
not pass any further judgment upon them. The subordination of Mineralogical Species to Orders is a
manifest gain to science: in the interposition of Genera
I see nothing but a source of confusion.</p>
<p id="b8c3s5">5. In Mineralogy, as in other branches of natural
history, a reformed arrangement ought to give rise to
a reformed Nomenclature; and for this, there is more
occasion at present in Mineralogy than there was in
Botany at the worst period, at least as far as the extent of the subject allows. The characters of minerals
are much more dimly and unfrequently developed
than those of plants; hence arbitrary chemical arrangements, which could not lead to any natural groups,
and therefore not to any good names, prevailed till
recently; and this state of things produced an anarchy <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page143">143</a></span> in which every man did what seemed right in his own
eyes,&#8212;proposed species without any ascertained distinction, and without a thought of subordination, and
gave them arbitrary names; and thus with only about
two or three hundred known species, we have thousands upon thousands of names, of anomalous form
and uncertain application.</p>
<p>Mohs has attempted to reform the Nomenclature of
the subject in a mode consistent with his attempt to
reform the System. In doing this, he has fatally transgressed a rule always insisted upon by the legislators
of Botany, of altering usual names as little as possible;
and his names are both so novel and so cumbrous,
that they appear to have little chance of permanent
currency. They are, perhaps, more unwieldy than
they need to be, by referring, as we have said, to three
of the steps of his classification, the Species, Genus,
and Order. We may, however, assert confidently, from
the whole analogy of natural history, that no good
names can be found which do not refer to at least <i>two</i>
terms of the arrangement. This rule has been practically adopted to a great extent by Naumann, who
gives to most of his Haloids the name <i>Spar</i>, as Calc
spar, Iron spar, &amp;c.; to all his Oxides the terminal
word <i>Erz</i> (<i>Ore</i>); and to the species of the orders <i>Kies</i>
(<i>Pyrites</i>), <i>Glance</i>, and <i>Blende</i>, these names. It has
also been theoretically assented to by Beudant, who
proposes that we should say <i>silicate stilbite</i>, <i>silicate
chabasie</i>; <i>carbonate calcaire</i>, <i>carbonate witherite</i>; <i>sulphate couperose</i>, &amp;c. One great difficulty in this case
would arise from the great number of <i>silicides</i>; it is
not likely that any names would obtain a footing which
tacked the term <i>silicide</i> to another word for each of
these species. The artifice which I have proposed, in
order to obviate this difficulty, is that we should
make the names of the silicides, and those alone, end
in <i>ite</i> or <i>lite</i>, which a large proportion of them do
already.</p>
<p>By this and a few similar contrivances, we might,
I conceive, without any inconvenient change, introduce
into Mineralogy a systematic nomenclature. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page144">144</a></span></p>
<p id="b8c3s6">6. I shall now proceed to make a few remarks on
a work on Mineralogy more recent than those which I
have above noticed, and written with express reference
to such difficulties as I have been discussing. I allude
to the treatise of M. Necker, <i>Le Règne Mineral ramené
aux Methods d’Histoire Naturelle</i><a id="fnanchor44-8" href="#note44-8"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a>, which also contains various dissertations on the Philosophy of Classification in general, and its application to Mineralogy
in particular.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-8" href="#fnanchor44-8">44</a></span> Paris, 1835.</div>
<p>M. Necker remarks very justly, that Mineralogy,
as it has hitherto been treated, differs from all other
branches of Natural History in this:&#8212;that while it is
invested with all the forms of the sciences of classification,&#8212;Classes, Divisions, Genera, and the like,&#8212;the
properties of those bodies to which the mineralogical
student’s attention is directed have no bearing whatever on the classification. A person, he remarks<a id="fnanchor45-8" href="#note45-8"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a>,
might be perfectly well acquainted with all the characters of minerals which Werner or Haüy examined so
carefully, and might yet be quite unable to assign to
any mineral its place in the divisions of their methods.
There is<a id="fnanchor46-8" href="#note46-8"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a> a complete separation between the study of
mineralogical characters and the recognition of the
name and systematic place of a mineral. Those who
know <em>mineralogy</em> well, may know <em>minerals</em> ill, or
hardly at all; the systematist may be in such knowledge vastly inferior to the mineral-dealer or the
miner. In this respect there is a complete contrast
between this science and other classificatory sciences.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-8" href="#fnanchor45-8">45</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 3.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-8" href="#fnanchor46-8">46</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 8.</div>
<p>Again, in the best-known systems of Mineralogy, (as
those of Werner and Haüy,). the bodies which are
grouped together as belonging to the same division,
have not, as they have in other classificatory sciences,
any resemblance. The different members of the larger
classes are united by the common possession of some
abstract property,&#8212;as, that they all contain iron. This
is a property to which no common circumstance in
the bodies themselves corresponds. What is there common to the minerals named oxidulous iron, sulphuret <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page145">145</a></span> of iron, carbonate of iron, sulphate of iron, except that
they all contain iron? And when we have classed these
bodies together, what general assertion can we make
concerning them, except that which is the ground of
our classification, that they contain iron? They have
nothing in common with iron or with each other in
any other way.</p>
<p>Again, as these classes have no general properties,
all the properties are particular to the species; and the
descriptions of these necessarily become both tediously
long, and inconveniently insulated.</p>
<p id="b8c3s7">7. These inconveniences arise from making Chemical Composition the basis of Mineralogical Classification without giving Chemical Analysis the first place
among Mineral Properties. Shall we, then, correct this
omission, so far as it has affected mineralogical systems? Shall we teach the student the chemical analysis of minerals, and then direct him to classify them
according to the results of his analysis<a id="fnanchor47-8" href="#note47-8"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a>?</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-8" href="#fnanchor47-8">47</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 18.</div>
<p>But why should we do this? To what purpose, or
on what ground, do we arrange the results of chemical
analysis according to the forms and subordination of
natural history? Is not Chemistry a science distinct
from Natural History? Are not the sciences opposed?
Is not natural history confined to organic bodies? Can
mere chemical elements and their combinations be,
with any propriety or consistency, arranged into Species, Genera, and Families? What is the principle
on which genera and species depend? Do not Species
imply Individuals? What is an Individual in the case
of a chemical substance?</p>
<p id="b8c3s8">8. We thus find some of the widest and deepest
questions of the philosophy of classification brought
under our consideration when we would provide a
method for the classification of minerals. The answers
to these questions are given by M. Necker; and I shall
state some of his opinions; taking the liberty of adding
such remarks as are suggested by referring the subject <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page146">146</a></span> to those principles which have already been established
in this work.</p>
<p>M. Necker asserts<a id="fnanchor48-8" href="#note48-8"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a> that the distinctions of different
Sciences depend, not on the objects they consider, but
on the different and independent points of view on
which they proceed. Each science has its logic, that
is, its mode of applying the general rules of human
reason to its own special case. It has been said by
some<a id="fnanchor49-8" href="#note49-8"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a>, that in minerals, natural history and chemistry
contemplate common objects, and thus form a single
science. But do chemistry and natural history consider minerals in the same point of view?</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-8" href="#fnanchor48-8">48</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 23.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-8" href="#fnanchor49-8">49</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 27.</div>
<p>The answer is, that they do not. Physics and Chemistry consider the properties of bodies in an abstract
manner; as, their composition, their elements, their
mutual actions, with the laws of these; their forces, as
attraction, affinity; all which objects are abstract ideas.
In these cases we have nothing to do with bodies
themselves, but as the vehicles of the powers and properties which we contemplate.</p>
<p>Natural History, on the other hand, has to do with
natural bodies: their properties are not considered abstractedly, but only as characters. If the properties
are abstracted, it is but for a moment. Natural history has to describe and class bodies as they are. All
which cannot be perceived by the senses, belongs not
to its domain, as molecules, atoms, elements.</p>
<p>Natural history<a id="fnanchor50-8" href="#note50-8"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a> may have recourse to physics or
chemistry in order to recognize those properties of
bodies which serve as characters; but natural history
is not, on that account, physics or chemistry. Classification is the essential business of the natural historian<a id="fnanchor51-8" href="#note51-8"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a>, to which task chemistry and physics are only
instrumental, and the further account of properties
only complementary.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-8" href="#fnanchor50-8">50</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 37.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-8" href="#fnanchor51-8">51</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 41.</div>
<p>It has been said, in support of the doctrine that
chemistry and mineralogy are identical, that chemistry
does not neglect external characters. ‘The chemist in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page147">147</a></span> describing sulphur, mentions its colour, taste, odour,
hardness, transparence, crystalline form, specific gravity; how does he then differ from the mineralogist?’
But to this it is replied, that these notices of the
external characters of this or any substance are introduced in chemistry merely as convenient marks of
recognition; whereas they are essential in mineralogy.
If we had taken the account given of several substances instead of one, we should have seen that the
chemist and the naturalist consider them in ways altogether different. The chemist will make it his business to discover the mutual action of the substances;
he will combine them, form new products, determine
the proportions of the elements. The mineralogist will
divide the substances into groups according to their
properties, and then subdivide these groups, till he
refers each substance to its species. Exterior and physical characters are merely accessory and subordinate
for the chemist; chemistry is merely instrumental for
the mineralogist.</p>
<p>This view agrees with that to which we have been
led by our previous reasonings; and may, according to
our principles, be expressed briefly by saying, that the
Idea which Chemistry has to apply is the Idea of Elementary Composition, while Natural History applies
the Idea of Graduated Resemblances, and thus performs the task of classification.</p>
<p id="b8c3s9">9. The question occurs<a id="fnanchor52-8" href="#note52-8"><span class="fnanchor">52</span></a>, whether Natural History
can be applied to Inorganic Substances? And the
answer to this question is, that it can be applied, if
there are such things as inorganic individuals, since
the resemblances and differences with which natural
history has to do are the resemblances and differences
of individuals.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-8" href="#fnanchor52-8">52</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 46.</div>
<p>What is an Individual? It certainly is not that
which is so simple that it cannot be divided. Individual animals are composed of many parts. But if
we examine, we shall find that our Idea of an Individual is, that it is a whole composed of parts, which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page148">148</a></span> are not similar to the whole, and have not an independent existence, while the whole has an independent
existence and a definite form<a id="fnanchor53-8" href="#note53-8"><span class="fnanchor">53</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-8" href="#fnanchor53-8">53</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 52.</div>
<p>What then is the Mineralogical Individual? At
first, while minerals were studied for their use, the
most precious of the substances which they contained
was looked upon as the characteristic of the mineral.
The smallest trace of silver made a mineral an <i>ore of
silver</i>. Thus forms and properties were disregarded,
and <i>substance</i> was considered as identical with <i>mineral</i>.
And hence<a id="fnanchor54-8" href="#note54-8"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> Daubenton refused to recognize <i>species</i> in
the mineral kingdom, because he recognized no individuals. He proposed to call <i>sorts</i> what we call species.
In this way of considering minerals, there are no individuals.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-8" href="#fnanchor54-8">54</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 54.</div>
<p id="b8c3s10">10. But still this is not satisfactory: for if we take
a well-formed and distinct crystal, this clearly <em>is</em> an
individual<a id="fnanchor55-8" href="#note55-8"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note55-8" href="#fnanchor55-8">55</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 56.</div>
<p>It may be objected, that the crystal is divisible
(according to the theory of crystallography) into smaller
solids; that these small solids are really the simple
objects; and that actual crystals are formed by combinations of these molecules according to certain laws.</p>
<p>But, as we have already said, an individual is such,
not because it cannot be divided, but because it cannot
be divided into parts similar to the whole. As to the
division of the form into its component <i>laws</i>, this is an
abstract proceeding, foreign to natural history<a id="fnanchor56-8" href="#note56-8"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a>. Therefore there is so far nothing to prevent a crystal from
being an individual.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-8" href="#fnanchor56-8">56</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 58.</div>
<p id="b8c3s11">11. We cannot (M. Necker goes on to remark)
consider the <i>Integrant Molecules</i> as individuals. These
are useful abstractions, but abstractions only, which
we must not deal with as real objects. Haüy himself
warns us<a id="fnanchor57-8" href="#note57-8"><span class="fnanchor">57</span></a> that his doctrine of increments is a purely
abstract conception, and that nature, in fact, follows a
different process. Accordingly, Weiss and Mohs express laws identical with those of Haüy, without even <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page149">149</a></span> speaking of molecules; and Wollaston and Davy have
deemed it probable that the molecules are not polyhedrons, but spheres or spheroids. Such mere creations of the mind can never be treated as individuals.
If the maxim of natural history,&#8212;that the Species is a
collection of Individuals&#8212;be applied so as to make
those individuals mere abstractions; or if, instead of
Individuals, we take such an abstraction as Substance
or Matter, the course of natural history is altogether
violated. And yet this errour has hitherto generally
prevailed; and mineralogists have classified, not things,
but abstract ideas<a id="fnanchor58-8" href="#note58-8"><span class="fnanchor">58</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note57-8" href="#fnanchor57-8">57</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 61.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note58-8" href="#fnanchor58-8">58</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 67.</div>
<p id="b8c3s12">12. But it may be said<a id="fnanchor59-8" href="#note59-8"><span class="fnanchor">59</span></a>, will not the small solids
obtained by Cleavage better answer the idea of individuals? To this it is replied, that these small solids
have no independent existence. They are only the
result of a mode of division. They are never found
separate and independent. The secondary forms which
they compose are determined by various circumstances
(the nature of the solution, &amp;c.); and the cleavage
which produces these small solids is only one result
among many, from the crystalline forces<a id="fnanchor60-8" href="#note60-8"><span class="fnanchor">60</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note59-8" href="#fnanchor59-8">59</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 69.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note60-8" href="#fnanchor60-8">60</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 71.</div>
<p>Thus neither Integrant Molecules, nor Solids obtained by Cleavage, can be such mineralogical Individuals as the spirit of natural history requires. Hence
it appears that we must take the real Crystals for
Individuals<a id="fnanchor61-8" href="#note61-8"><span class="fnanchor">61</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note61-8" href="#fnanchor61-8">61</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 73.</div>
<p id="b8c3s13">13. We must, however, reject crystals (generally
large ones) which are obviously formed of several
smaller ones of a similar form (as occurs so often in
quartz and calc spar). We must also distinguish cases
in which a large regular form is composed of smaller
but different regular forms (as octahedrons of fluor
spar made up of cubes). Here the small component
forms are the individuals. Also we must notice the
cases<a id="fnanchor62-8" href="#note62-8"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a> in which we have a natural crystal, similar to
the primary form. Here the face will show whether <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page150">150</a></span> the body is a result obtained by cleavage or a natural
individual.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note62-8" href="#fnanchor62-8">62</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 75.</div>
<p id="b8c3s14">14. It will be objected<a id="fnanchor63-8" href="#note63-8"><span class="fnanchor">63</span></a>, that the crystalline form
ought not to be made the dominant character in mineralogy, since it rarely occurs perfect. To this it is
replied, that even if the application of the principle be
difficult, still it has been shown to be the only true
principle, and therefore we have no alternative. But
further<a id="fnanchor64-8" href="#note64-8"><span class="fnanchor">64</span></a>, it is not true that amorphous substances are
more numerous than crystals. In Leonhard’s <i>Manual
of Oryctognosy</i>, there are 377 mineral substances. Of
these, 281 have a crystalline structure, and 96 only
have not been found in a regular form.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note63-8" href="#fnanchor63-8">63</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 79.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note64-8" href="#fnanchor64-8">64</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 82.</div>
<p>Again, the 281 crystalline forms have each its varieties, some of which are crystalline, and some are not
so. Now the crystalline varieties amount to 1453, and
the uncrystalline to 186 only. Thus mineralogy, according to the view of it here presented, has a sufficiently wide field<a id="fnanchor65-8" href="#note65-8"><span class="fnanchor">65</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note65-8" href="#fnanchor65-8">65</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 84.</div>
<p id="b8c3s15">15. It will be objected<a id="fnanchor66-8" href="#note66-8"><span class="fnanchor">66</span></a>, that according to this
mode of proceeding, we must reject from our system
all non-crystalline minerals. But we reply, that if
the mass be composed of crystals, the size of the crystals makes no difference. Now lamellar and other
compact masses are very generally groups of crystals in
various positions. Individuals mutilated and mixed
together are not the less individuals; and therefore
such masses may be treated as objects of natural
history.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note66-8" href="#fnanchor66-8">66</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 86.</div>
<p>If we cannot refer all rocks to crystalline species,
those which elude our method may appear as an appendix, corresponding to those plants which botanists
call <i>genera incertæ sedis</i><a id="fnanchor67-8" href="#note67-8"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note67-8" href="#fnanchor67-8">67</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 91.</div>
<p>But these genera and species will often be afterwards removed into the crystalline part of the system,
by being identified with crystalline species. Thus
<i>pyrope</i>, &amp;c., have been referred to <i>garnet</i>, and <i>basalt</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page151">151</a></span> <i>wacke</i>, &amp;c., to compound rocks. Thus veins of <i>Dolerite</i>,
visibly composed of two or three elements, pass to an
apparently simple state by becoming fine-grained<a id="fnanchor68-8" href="#note68-8"><span class="fnanchor">68</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-8" href="#fnanchor68-8">68</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 93.</div>
<p id="b8c3s16">16. Finally<a id="fnanchor69-8" href="#note69-8"><span class="fnanchor">69</span></a>, we have to ask, are artificial crystals
to enter into our classification? M. Necker answers,
No; because they are the result of art, like mules,
mestizos, hybrids, and the like.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note69-8" href="#fnanchor69-8">69</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 95.</div>
<p id="b8c3s17">17. Upon these opinions, we may observe, that they
appear to be, in the main, consistent with the soundest
philosophy. That each natural crystal is an individual,
is a doctrine which is the only basis of Mineralogy as a
Natural Historical Science; yet the imperfections and
confused unions of crystals make this principle difficult
to apply. Perhaps it may be expressed in a more precise manner by referring to the crystalline forces, and
to the axes by which their operation is determined,
rather than to the external form. <em>That</em> portion of a
mineral substance is a mineralogical <em>individual</em> which
is determined by crystalline forces acting to the <em>same
axes</em>. In this way we avoid the difficulty arising from
the absence of faces, and enable ourselves to use either
cleavage, or optical properties, or any others, as indications of the identity of the individual. The individual extends so far as the polar forces extend by
which crystalline form is determined, whether or not
those forces produce their full effect, namely, a perfectly circumscribed polyhedron.</p>
<p id="b8c3s18">18. There is only one material point on which our
principles lead us to differ from M. Necker;&#8212;the propriety of including <i>artificial crystals</i> in our mineralogical classification. To exclude them, as he does, is a
conclusion so entirely at variance with the whole
course of his own reasonings, that it is difficult to conceive that he would persist in his conclusion, if his
attention were drawn to the question more steadily.
For, as he justly says<a id="fnanchor70-8" href="#note70-8"><span class="fnanchor">70</span></a>, each science has its appropriate
domain, determined by its peculiar point of view.
Now artificial and natural crystals are considered in
the same point of view, (namely, with reference to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page152">152</a></span> crystalline, physical, and optical properties, as subservient to classification,) and ought, therefore, to belong
to the same science. Again, he says<a id="fnanchor71-8" href="#note71-8"><span class="fnanchor">71</span></a>, that Chemistry
would reject as useless all notice of the physical properties and external characters of substances, if a
<i>special science</i> were to take charge of the description
and classification of these products. But such a special
science must be Mineralogy; for we cannot well make
one science of the classification of natural, and another
of that of artificial substances: or if we do, the two
sciences will be identical in method and principles,
and will extend over each other’s boundaries, so that
it will be neither useful nor possible to distinguish
them. Again, M. Necker’s own reasonings on the
selection of the individual in mineralogy are supported
by well chosen examples<a id="fnanchor72-8" href="#note72-8"><span class="fnanchor">72</span></a>; but these examples are
taken from artificial salts; as, for instance, common
salt crystallizing in different mixtures. Again, the
analogy of mules and mestizos, as products of art, with
chemical compounds, is not just. Chemical compounds
correspond rather to natural species, propagated by
man under the most natural circumstances, in order
that he may study the laws of their production<a id="fnanchor73-8" href="#note73-8"><span class="fnanchor">73</span></a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note73-8" href="#fnanchor73-8">73</a></span> We may remark that M. Necker, in his own arrangement of minerals,
inserts among his species Iron and Lead, which do not occur Native.</div>
<p id="b8c3s19">19. But the decisive argument against the separation of natural and artificial crystals in our schemes of
classification is, that we <em>cannot</em> make such a separation. Substances which were long known only as the
products of the laboratory, are often discovered, after
a time, in natural deposits. Are the crystals which
are found in a forgotten retort or solution to be considered as belonging to a different science from those
which occur in a deserted mine? And are the crystals
which are produced where man has turned a stream of
water or air out of its course, to be separated from
natural crystals, when the composition, growth, and
properties, are exactly the same in both? And again:
How many natural crystals can we already produce by <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page153">153</a></span> synthesis! How many more may we hope to imitate
hereafter! M. Necker himself states<a id="fnanchor74-8" href="#note74-8"><span class="fnanchor">74</span></a>, that Mitscherlich found, in the scoriæ of the mines of Sweden and
Germany, artificial minerals having the same composition and the same crystalline form with natural minerals: as silicates of iron, lime, and magnesia, agreeing
with Peridot; bisilicate of iron, lime, and magnesia,
agreeing with Pyroxene; red oxide of copper; oxide
of zinc; protoxide of iron (<i>fer oxydulé</i>); sulphurets
of iron, zinc, lead; arseniuret of nickel; black mica.
These were accidental results of fusion. But M. Berthier, by bringing together the elements in proper
quantities, has succeeded in composing similar minerals, and has thus obtained artificial silicates, with the
same forms and the same characters as natural silicates.
Other chemists (M. Haldat, M. Becquerel) have, in
like manner, obtained, by artificial processes, other
crystals, known previously as occurring naturally.
How are these crystals, thus identical with natural
minerals, to be removed out of the domain of mineralogy, and transferred to a science which shall classify
artificial crystals only? If this be done, the mineralogist will not be able to classify any specimen till he
has human testimony whether it was found naturally
occurring or produced by chemical art. Or is the
other alternative to be taken, and are these crystals
to be given up to mineralogy because they occur naturally also? But what can be more unphilosophical
than to refer to separate sciences the results of chemical processes closely allied, and all but identical? The
chemist constructs bisilicates, and these are classified
by the mineralogist: but if he constructs a trisilicate,
it belongs to another science. All these intolerable
incongruities are avoided by acknowledging that artificial, as well as natural, crystals belong to the domain
of mineralogy. It is, in fact, the <em>name</em> only of <i>Mineralogy</i> which appears to discover any inconsistency in
this mode of proceeding. Mineralogy is the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page154">154</a></span> representative of a science which has a wider office than mineralogists first contemplated; but which must exist, in
order that the body of science may be complete. There
must, as we have already said, be a Science, the object
of which is to classify bodies by their physical characters, in order that we may have some means of
asserting chemical truths concerning bodies; some
language in which we may express the propositions
which chemical analysis discovers. And this Science
will have its object prescribed, not by any accidental
or arbitrary difference of the story belonging to each
specimen;&#8212;not by knowing whether the specimen
was found in the mine or in the laboratory; produced
by attempting to imitate nature, or to do violence to
her:&#8212;but will have its course determined by its own
character. The range and boundaries of this Science
will be regulated by the Ideas with which it deals.
Like all other sciences, it must extend to everything
to which its principles apply. The limits of the province which it includes are fixed by the consideration
that it must be a connected whole. No previous definition, no historical accident, no casual phrase, can at
all stand in the way of philosophical consistency;&#8212;can
make this Science exclude what that includes, or
oblige it to admit what that rejects. And thus, whatever we call our Science;&#8212;whether we term it External Chemistry, Mineralogy, the Natural History of
Inorganic Bodies;&#8212;since it can be nothing but the
Science of the Classification of Inorganic Bodies of
definite forms and properties, it must classify all such
bodies, whether or not they be minerals, and whether
or not they be natural.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note74-8" href="#fnanchor74-8">74</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 151.</div>
<p id="b8c3s20">20. In the application of the principles of classification to minerals, the question occurs, What are to be
considered as mineral <i>Species</i>? By Species we are to
understand, according to the usage of other parts of
natural history, the lowest step of our subordinate
divisions;&#8212;the most limited of the groups which have
definite distinctions. What definite distinctions of
groups of objects of any kind really occur in nature, is
to be learnt from an examination of nature: and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page155">155</a></span> result of our inquiries will be some general principle
which connects the members of each group, and distinguishes the members of groups which, though contiguous, are different. In the classification of organized
bodies, the rule which thus presides over the formation
of Species is the principle of <i>reproduction</i>. Those animals and those plants are of the same Species which
are produced from a common stock, or which resemble
each other as much as the progeny of a common stock.
Accordingly in practice, if any questions arise whether
two varieties of form in organic things be of the same
or different species, it is settled by reference to the
fact of reproduction; and when it is ascertained that
the two forms come within the habitual and regular
limits of a common circle of reproduction, they are held
to be of the same species. Now in crystals, this principle
of reproduction disappears altogether, and the basis of
the formation of species must be sought elsewhere. We
must have some other principle to replace the reproduction which belongs only to organic life. This principle will be, we may expect, one which secures the
permanence and regularity of mineral forms, as the
reproductive power does of animal and vegetable. Such
a principle is the <i>Power of Crystallization</i>. The forces
of which solidity, cohesion, and crystallization are the
result, are those which give to minerals their permanent existence and their physical properties; and ever
since the discovery of the distinctions of Crystalline
Forms and Crystalline Systems, it is certain that this
force distinguishes groups of crystals in the most precise and definite manner. The rhombohedral carbonates of lime and of iron, for instance, are distinguished
exactly by the angles of their rhombohedrons. And
if, in the case of any proposed crystal, we should doubt
to which kind the specimen belongs, the measurement
of the angles of cleavage would at once decide the
question. The principle of Crystallization therefore appears, from analogy, to be exactly fitted to take the
place of the principle of organic Generation. The forces
which make the individual permanent and its properties definite, here stand in the place of the forces <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page156">156</a></span> which preserve the race, while individuals are generated and die.</p>
<p id="b8c3s21">21. According to this view, the different Modifications of the <em>same</em> crystalline form would be <em>Varieties</em>
only of the same Species. All the various solids, for
example, which are produced by the different laws of
derivation of rhombohedral carbonate of lime, would
fall within the same Species. And this appears to be
required by the general analogy of Natural History.
For these differences of form, produced by the laws of
crystalline derivation, are not <em>definite</em>. The faces
which are added to one form in order to produce
another, may be of any size, small or large, and thus
the crystal which represents one modification passes by
insensible degrees to another. The forms of calc spar,
which we call <i>dog-tooth spar</i>, <i>cannon spar</i>, <i>nail-head
spar</i>, and the like, appear at first, no doubt, distinct
enough; but so do the races of dogs. And we find, in
the mineral as in the animal, that the distinction is
obliterated by taking such intermediate steps as really
occur. And if a <i>fragment</i> of any of these crystals is
given us, we can determine that it is rhombohedral
carbonate of lime; but it is not possible, in general,
to determine to which of the kinds of crystals it has
belonged.</p>
<p id="b8c3s22">22. Notwithstanding these considerations, M. Necker
has taken for his basis of mineral species<a id="fnanchor75-8" href="#note75-8"><span class="fnanchor">75</span></a> the <i>Secondary</i> Modifications, and not the Primary Forms. Thus
<i>cubical galena</i>, <i>octahedral galena</i>, and <i>triform galena</i>,
are, with him, three <i>species</i> of crystals.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note75-8" href="#fnanchor75-8">75</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 396.</div>
<p>On this I have to observe, as I have already done,
that on this principle we have no <em>definite</em> distinction of
species; for these forms may and do pass into each
other: among cubo-octahedrons of galena occur cubes
and octahedrons, as one face or another vanishes, and
the transition is insensible. We shall, on this principle,
find almost always three or four species in the same
tuft of crystals; for almost every individual in such
assemblages may exhibit a different combination of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page157">157</a></span> secondary faces. Again, in cases where the secondary
laws are numerous, it would be impracticable to enumerate all their combinations, and impossible therefore
to give a list of species. Accordingly M. Necker<a id="fnanchor76-8" href="#note76-8"><span class="fnanchor">76</span></a> gives
seventy-one Species of <i>spath calcaire</i>, and then says,
‘Nous n’avons pas énumeré la dixième partie des
espèces connues de ce genre, qui se montent à plus de
huit cents.’ Again, in many substances, of which few
crystals are found, every new specimen would be a
new species; if indeed it were perfect enough to be
referred to a species at all. But from a specimen
without perfect external form, however perfect in
crystalline character, although everything else might
be known,&#8212;angles, optical properties, physical properties, and chemical constitution,&#8212;the species could not
be determined. Thus M. Necker says<a id="fnanchor77-8" href="#note77-8"><span class="fnanchor">77</span></a> of the micas,
‘Quant aux espèces propre à chaque genre, la lacune
sera presque complète; car jusqu’ici les cristaux entiers
de Mica et de Talc n’ont pas été fort communs.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note76-8" href="#fnanchor76-8">76</a></span> <i>Règne Mineral</i>, p. 364.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note77-8" href="#fnanchor77-8">77</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> ii. 414.</div>
<p>These inconveniences arise from neglecting the leading rule of natural history, that the <em>predominant principle</em> of the existence of an object must determine the
Species; whether this principle be Reproduction operating for Development, or Crystallization operating
for Permanence of form. We may add to the above
statement of inconveniences this;&#8212;that if M. Necker’s
view of mineralogical species be adopted, the distinction of Species is vague and indefinite, while that of
Genera is perfectly precise and rigorous;&#8212;an aspect
of the system entirely at variance with other parts of
Natural History; for in all these the Species is a more
definite group than the Genus.</p>
<p>This result follows, as has already been said, from
M. Necker’s wish to have individuals marked by external form. If, instead of this, we are contented to
take for an individual that portion of a mass, of whatever form, which is connected by the continuous influence of the same crystalline forces, by whatever incidents these forces may be manifested, (as cleavage, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page158">158</a></span> physical and optical properties, and the like,) our
mode of proceeding avoids all the above inconveniences, applies alike to the most perfect and most imperfect specimens, and gives a result agreeable to the
general analogy of natural history, and the rules of its
methods<a id="fnanchor78-8" href="#note78-8"><span class="fnanchor">78</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note78-8" href="#fnanchor78-8">78</a></span> I will not again enter into the subject of Nomenclature; but I may remark that M. Necker has adopted (i. 415) the Nomenclature of Beudant, latinizing the names, and thus converting each into a single word. He has also introduced, besides the names of Genera, names of Families taken from the <i>typical</i> Genus. Thus the Family of <i>Carbonidiens</i> contains the following genera: <i>Calcispathum</i>, <i>Magnesispathum</i>, <i>Dolomispathum</i>, <i>Ferrispathum</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, <i>Malachita</i>, <i>Azuria</i>, <i>Gaylusacia</i>.</div>
<p>I now quit the subject of mere Resemblance, and

Systems of Classification for organic bodies must involve.</p>

<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span>N
the Second <a href="#v2page108">Chapter</a> of this Book it was
shown that although the Classificatory Sciences proceed ostensibly upon the Idea of Resemblance
as their main foundation, they necessarily take for
granted in the course of their progress a further Idea
of Natural Affinity. This appeared<a id="fnanchor79-8" href="#note79-8"><span class="fnanchor">79</span></a> by a general consideration of the nature of Science, by the recognition
of natural species and genera, even in Artificial Systems of Classification<a id="fnanchor80-8" href="#note80-8"><span class="fnanchor">80</span></a>, and by the <span class="correction" title="emended from attemps">attempts</span> of botanists
to form a Natural System. It further appeared that
among the processes by which endeavours have been
made to frame a Natural System, some, as the method
of <i>Blind Trial</i> and the method of <i>General Comparison</i>,
have been altogether unsuccessful, being founded only
upon a collection of resemblances, casual in the one
case and arbitrary in the other. In neither of these
processes is there employed any general principle by
which we may be definitely directed as to what resemblances we should employ, or by which the result at
which we arrive may be verified and confirmed. Our
object in the present chapter is to show that the Idea
of Natural Affinity supplies us with a principle which
may answer such purposes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note79-8" href="#fnanchor79-8">79</a></span> Art. 5.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note80-8" href="#fnanchor80-8">80</a></span> Art. 7.</div>
<p>I shall first consider the Idea of Affinity as exemplified in organized beings. In doing this, we may appear
to take for granted Ideas which have not yet come
under our discussion, as the Ideas of Organization, and
Vital Function; but it will be found that the principle
to which we are led is independent of these additional
Ideas. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page160">160</a></span></p>
<p id="b8c4s2">2. We have already seen that the attempts to discover the divisions which result from this Natural
Affinity have led to the consideration of the <i>Subordination of Characters</i>. It is easy to see that some
organs are more essential than others to the existence
of an organized being; the organs of nutrition, for
example, more essential than those of locomotion. But
at the same time it is clear that any <em>arbitrary</em> assumption of a certain scale of relative values of different
kinds of characters will lead only to an Artificial System. This will happen, if, for example, we begin by
declaring the nutritive to be superior in importance to
the reproductive functions. It is clear that this relation of importance of organs and functions must be
collected by the study of the organized beings; and
cannot be determined <i>à priori</i>, without depriving us
of all right to expect a general accordance between our
system and the arrangement of nature. We see, therefore, that our notion of Natural Affinity involves in it
this consequence;&#8212;that it is not to be made out by an
arbitrary subordination of characters.</p>
<p id="b8c4s3">3. The functions and actions of living things which
we separate from each other in our consideration, cannot be severed in nature. Each function is essential;
Life implies a collection of movements, and ceases
when any of these movements is stopped. A change
in the organization subservient to one set of functions
may lead necessarily to a change in the organization
belonging to others. We can often see this necessary
connexion; and from a comparison of the forms of
organized beings,&#8212;from the way in which their structure changes in passing from one class to another, we
are led to the conviction that there is some general
principle which connects and graduates all such changes.
When the circulatory system changes, the nervous
system changes also: when the mode of locomotion
changes, the respiration is also modified.</p>
<p id="b8c4s4">4. These corresponding changes may be considered
as ways in which the living thing is fitted to its mode
of life; as marks of <i>adaptation to a purpose</i>; or, as it
has been otherwise expressed, as results of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page161">161</a></span> <i>conditions of existence</i>. But at the present moment, we put
forward these correspondencies in a different light.
We adduce them as illustrations of what we mean by
Affinity, and what we consider as the tendency of a
Natural Classification. It has sometimes been asserted
that if we were to classify any of the departments of
organized nature by means of one function, and then
by means of another, the two classifications, if each
strictly consistent with itself, would be consistent with
each other. Such an assertion is perhaps more than
we are entitled to make with confidence; but it shows
very well what is meant by Affinity. The disposition
to believe such a general identity of all partial natural
classifications, shows how readily we fix upon the
notion of Affinity, as a general result of the causes
which determine the forms of living things. When
these causes or principles, of whatever nature they are
conceived to be, vary so as to modify one part of the
organization of the being, they also modify another:
and thus the groups which exhibit this variation of
the fundamental principles of form, are the same,
whether the manifestation of the change be sought in
one part or in another of the organized structure. The
groups thus formed are related by Affinity; and in
proportion as we find the evidence of more functions
and more organs to the propriety of our groups, we
are more and more satisfied that they are Natural
Classes. It appears, then, that our Idea of Affinity
involves the conviction of the <em>Coincidence of natural
arrangements formed on different functions</em>; and this,
rather than the principle of the Subordination of some
characters to others, is the true ground of the natural
method of Classification.</p>
<p id="b8c4s5">5. For example, Cuvier, after speaking of the Subordination of Characters as the guide which he intends
to follow in his arrangement of animals, interprets this
principle in such a manner<a id="fnanchor81-8" href="#note81-8"><span class="fnanchor">81</span></a> as to make it agree nearly
with the one just stated: ‘In pursuance of what has
been said on methods in general, we now require to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page162">162</a></span> know what characters in animals are the most influential, and therefore those which must be made the
grounds of the primary divisions.’ ‘These,’ he says,
‘it is clear must be those which are taken from the
animal functions;&#8212;sensation and motion:’&#8212;But how
does he confirm this? Not by showing that the animal
functions are independent of, or predominant over, the
vegetative, but by observing that they follow the same
gradations. ‘Observation,’ he continues, ‘confirms
this view, by showing that the degrees of development
and complication of the animal functions agree with
those of the vegetative. The heart and the organs of
the circulation are a sort of center for the vegetative
functions, as the brain and the trunk of the nervous
system are for the animal functions. Now we see
these two systems descend in the scale, and disappear
the one with the other. In the lowest animals, when
there are no longer any distinct nerves, there are also
no longer distinct fibres, and the organs of digestion
are simply hollowed out in the homogeneous mass of
the body. The muscular system disappears even before the nervous, in insects; but in general the distribution of the medullary masses corresponds to that of
the muscular instruments; a spinal cord, on which
knots or ganglions represent so many brains, corresponds to a body divided into numerous rings and
supported on pairs of members placed at different
points of the length, and so on.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note81-8" href="#fnanchor81-8">81</a></span> <i>Règne Animal</i>, p. 55.</div>
<p>‘This <i>correspondence</i> of the general forms which
result from the arrangement of the motive organs,
from the distribution of the nervous masses, and from
the energy of the circulatory system, must therefore
form the ground of the first great sections by which
we divide the animal kingdom.’</p>
<p id="b8c4s6">6. Decandolle takes the same view. There must
be, he says, <i>an equilibrium</i> of the different functions<a id="fnanchor82-8" href="#note82-8"><span class="fnanchor">82</span></a>.
And he exemplifies this by the case of the distinction
of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, which
being at first established by means of the organs of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page163">163</a></span> reproduction, was afterwards found to coincide with the
distinction of endogenous and exogenous, which depends on the process of nutrition. ‘Thus,’ he adds,
‘<em>the natural classes founded on one of the great functions of the vegetable are necessarily the same as those
which are founded upon the other function</em>; and I
find here a very useful criterion to ascertain whether a
class is natural: namely, in order to announce that it
is so, it must be arrived at by the two roads which
vegetable organization presents. Thus I affirm,’ he
says, ‘that the division of monocotyledons from dicotyledons, and the distinction of Gramineæ from Cyperaceæ, are real, because in these cases, I arrive at the
same result by the reproductive and the nutritive
organs; while the distinction of monopetalous and
polypetalous, of Rhodoraceæ and Ericineæ, appears to
me artificial, because I can arrive at it only by the
reproductive organs.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note82-8" href="#fnanchor82-8">82</a></span> <i>Theor. Elem.</i> p. 79.</div>
<p>Thus the Correspondence of the indications of different functions is the criterion of Natural Classes;
and this correspondence may be considered as one of
the best and most characteristic marks of the fundamental Idea of Affinity. And the Maxim by which
all Systems professing to be natural must be tested is
this:&#8212;that the <em>arrangement obtained from one set of
characters coincides with the arrangement obtained
from another set</em>.</p>
<p>This Idea of Affinity, as a natural connexion among
various species, of which connexion all particular resemblances are indications, has principally influenced
the attempts at classifying the animal kingdom. The
reason why the classification in this branch of Natural
History has been more easy and certain than that of
the vegetable world is, as Decandolle says<a id="fnanchor83-8" href="#note83-8"><span class="fnanchor">83</span></a>, that besides the functions of nutrition and reproduction, which
animals have in common with plants, they have also
in addition the function of sensation; and thus have a
new means of verification and concordance. But we
may add, as a further reason, that the functions of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page164">164</a></span> animals are necessarily much more obvious and intelligible to us than those of vegetables, from their clear
resemblance to the operations which take place in our
own bodies, to which our attention has necessarily been
strongly directed.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note83-8" href="#fnanchor83-8">83</a></span> <i>Theor. Elem.</i> p. 80.</div>
<p id="b8c4s7">7. The question here offers itself, whether this Idea
of Natural Affinity is applicable to inorganic as well
as to organic bodies;&#8212;whether there be Natural Affinities among Minerals. And to this we are now
enabled to reply by considering whether or not the
principle just stated is applicable in such cases. And
the conclusion to which our principle leads us is,&#8212;that there are such Natural Affinities among Minerals,
since there are different sets of characters which may
be taken, (and have by different writers been taken,)
as the basis of classification. The hardness, specific
gravity, colour, lustre, crystallization, and other <i>external</i> characters, as they are termed, form one body of
properties according to which minerals may be classified; as has in fact been done by Mohs, Breithaupt,
and others. The <i>chemical</i> constitution of the substances, on the other hand, may be made the principle
of their arrangement, as was done by Haüy, and more
recently, and on a different scheme, by Berzelius.
Which of these is the true and natural classification?
To this we answer, that <em>each</em> of these arrangements is
true and natural, then, and then only, when it coincides with the other. An arrangement by external
characters which gives us classes possessing a common
chemical character;&#8212;a chemical order which brings
together like and separates unlike minerals;&#8212;such
classifications have the evidence of truth in their
agreement with one another. Every classification of
minerals which does not aim at and tend to such a
result, is so far merely arbitrary; and cannot be subservient to the expression of general chemical and
mineralogical truths, which is the proper purpose of
such a classification.</p>
<p id="b8c4s8">8. In the History of Mineralogy I have related
the advances which have been made among mineralogists and chemists in modern times towards a System <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page165">165</a></span> possessing this character of truth. I have there described the mixed systems of Werner and Haüy;&#8212;the
attempt made by Mohs to form a pure Natural History
system;&#8212;the first and second attempt of Berzelius to
form a pure chemical system; and the failure of both
these attempts. But the distinct separation of the two
elements of which science requires the coincidence
threw a very useful light upon the subject; and the
succeeding mixed systems, such as that of Naumann,
approached much nearer to the true conditions of the
problem than any of the preceding ones had done.
Thus, as I have stated, several of Naumann’s groups
have both a common chemical character and great
external resemblances. Such are his <i>Anhydrous Unmetallic Haloids</i>&#8212;his <i>Anhydrous Metallic Haloids</i>&#8212;<i>Hydrous Metallic Haloids</i>&#8212;<i>Oxides</i> of metals&#8212;<i>Pyrites</i>&#8212;<i>Glances</i>&#8212;<i>Blendes</i>. The existence of such groups
shows that we may hope ultimately to obtain a classification of minerals which shall be both chemically
significant, and agreeable to the methods of Natural
History: although when we consider how very imperfect as yet our knowledge of the chemical composition of minerals is, we can hardly flatter ourselves
that we shall arrive at such a result very soon.</p>
<p>We have thus seen that in Mineralogy, as well as
in the sciences which treat of organized bodies, we may
apply the Idea of Natural Affinity; of which the fundamental maxim is, that <em>arrangements obtained from
different sets of characters must coincide</em>.</p>
<p>Since the notion of Affinity is thus applicable to
inorganic as well as to organic bodies, it is plain that
it is not a mere modification of the Idea of Organization or Function, although it may in some of its aspects
appear to approach near to these other Ideas. But
these Ideas, or others which are the foundation of
them, necessarily enter in a very prominent and fundamental manner into all the other parts of Natural
History. To the consideration of these, therefore, we
shall now proceed.</p>

the History of the Sciences, after treating of
the Sciences of Classification, we proceeded to
what are there termed the Organical Sciences, including
in this term Physiology and Comparative Anatomy.
A peculiar feature in this group of sciences is that
they involve the notion of <em>living</em> things. The notion
of <i>Life</i>, however vague and obscure it may be in men’s
minds, is apprehended as a peculiar Idea, not resolvable into any other Ideas, such, for instance, as Matter
and Motion. The separation between living creatures
and inert matter, between organized and unorganized
beings, is conceived as a positive and insurmountable
barrier. The two classes of objects are considered as
of a distinct kind, produced and preserved by different
forces. Whether the Idea of Life is really thus original and fundamental, and whether, if so, it be one
Idea only, or involve several, it must be the province
of true philosophy to determine. What we shall here
offer may be considered as an attempt to contribute
something to the determination of these questions;
but we shall perhaps be able to make it appear that
science is at present only in the course of its progress
towards a complete solution of such problems.</p>
<p>Since the main feature of those sciences of which
we have now to examine the philosophy is, that they <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page170">170</a></span> involve the Idea of Life, it would be desirable to have
them designated by a name expressive of that circumstance. The word <i>Physiology</i>, by which they have
most commonly been described, means <i>the Science of
Nature</i>; and though it would be easy to explain, by
reference to history, the train of thought by which the
word was latterly restricted to <i>Living Nature</i>, it is plain
that the name is, etymologically speaking, loose and
improper. The term <i>Biology</i>, which means exactly
what we wish to express, <i>the Science of Life</i>, has often
been used, and has of late become not uncommon
among good winters. I shall therefore venture to employ it, in most cases, rather than the word <i>Physiology</i>.</p>
<p id="b9c1s2">2. As I have already intimated, one main inquiry
belonging to the Philosophy of Biology, is concerning
the Fundamental Idea or Ideas which the science involves. If we look back at the course and the results
of our disquisitions respecting other sciences in this
work, and assume, as we may philosophically do, that
there will be some general analogy between those
sciences and this, in their development and progress,
we shall be enabled to anticipate in some measure the
nature of the view which we shall now have to take.
We have seen that in other subjects the Fundamental
Ideas on which science depended, and the Conceptions
derived from these, were at first vague, obscure, and
confused;&#8212;that by gradual steps, by a constant union
of thought and observation, these conceptions become
more and more clear, more and more definite;&#8212;and
that when they approached complete distinctness and
precision, there were made great positive discoveries
into which these conceptions entered; and thus the
new precision of thought was fixed and perpetuated
in some conspicuous and lasting truths. Thus we
have seen how the first confused mechanical conceptions (Force, and the like,) were, from time to time,
growing clearer, down to the epoch of Newton;&#8212;how true conceptions of Genera and of wider classes,
gradually unfolded themselves among the botanists of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;&#8212;how the
idea of Substance became steady enough to govern the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page171">171</a></span> theories of chemists only at the epoch of Lavoisier;&#8212;how the Idea of Polarity, although often used by physicists and chemists, is even now somewhat vague and
indistinct in the minds of the greater part of speculators. In like manner we may expect to find that the
Idea of Life, if indeed <em>that</em> be the governing Idea of
the Science which treats of Living Things, will be
found to have been gradually approaching towards a
distinct and definite form among the physiologists of all
ages up to the present day. And if this be the case, it
may not be considered superfluous, with reference to
so interesting a subject, if we employ some space in
tracing historically the steps of this progress;&#8212;the
changes by which the originally loose notion of Life, or
of Vital Powers, became more nearly an Idea suited to
the purposes of science.</p>
<p id="b9c1s3">3. But we may safely carry this analogy between
Biology and other sciences somewhat further. We
have seen, in other sciences, that while men in their
speculations were thus tending towards a certain peculiar Idea, but before they as yet saw clearly that it was
peculiar and independent, they naturally and inevitably clothed their speculations in conceptions borrowed
from some other extraneous idea. And the unsatisfactoriness of all such attempts, and the necessary consequence of this, a constant alteration and succession
of such inappropriate hypotheses, were indications and
aids of the progress which was going on towards a more
genuine form of the science. For instance, we have
seen that in chemistry, so long as men refused to recognize a peculiar and distinct kind of power in the
<i>Affinity</i> which binds together the elements of bodies,
they framed to themselves a series of hypotheses, each
constructed according to the prevalent ideas of the
time, by which they tried to represent the relation of
the compound to the ingredients:&#8212;first, supposing
that the elements bestowed upon the whole qualities
<em>resembling</em> their own:&#8212;then giving up this supposition, and imagining that the properties of the body
depended upon the <em>shape</em> of the component particles;&#8212;then, as their view expanded, assuming that it was <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page172">172</a></span> not the shape, but the mechanical <em>forces</em> of the particles which gave the body its attributes;&#8212;and finally
acquiescing in, or rather reluctantly admitting, the
idea of <i>Affinity</i>, conceived as a peculiar power, different not only from material contact, but from any mechanical or dynamical attraction.</p>
<p>Now we cannot but think it very natural, if we find
that the history of Biology offers a series of occurrences
of the same nature. The notions of Life in general,
or of any Vital Functions or Vital Forces in particular,
are obviously very loose and vague as they exist in the
minds of most men. The discrepancies and controversies respecting the definitions of all such terms,
which are found in all works on physiology, afford us
abundant evidence that these notions are not, at least
not generally, apprehended with complete clearness
and steadiness. We shall therefore find approaches
and advances, intermediate steps, gradually leading
up to the greatest degree of distinctness which has yet
been attained. And in those stages of imperfect
apprehension in which the notions of Life and of Vital
Powers are still too loose and unformed to be applied
independently, we may expect to find them supported
and embodied by means of hypotheses borrowed from
other subjects, and thus, made so distinct and substantial as to supply at least a temporary possibility of
scientific reasoning upon the laws of life.</p>
<p id="b9c1s4">4. For example, if we suppose that men begin to
speculate upon the properties of living things, not
acknowledging a peculiar Vital Power, but making
use successively of the knowledge supplied by the study
of other subjects, we may easily imagine a series of
hypotheses along which they would pass.</p>
<p>They would probably, first, in this as in other
sciences, have their thoughts occupied by vague and
<i>mystical</i> notions in which material and spiritual agency,
natural and supernatural events, were mixed together
without discrimination, and without any clear notion
at all. But as they acquired a more genuine perception of the nature of <span class="correction" title="emended from knowlege">knowledge</span>, they would naturally
try to explain vital motions and processes by means of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page173">173</a></span> such forces as they had learnt the existence of from
other sciences. They might first have a <i>mechanical</i>
hypothesis, in which the mechanical <i>Forces</i> of the solids
and fluids which compose organized bodies should be
referred to, as the most important influences in the
process of life. They might then attend to the actions
which the fluids exercise in virtue of their <i>Affinity</i>,
and might thus form a <i>chemical</i> theory. When they
had proved the insufficience of these hypotheses, borrowed from the powers which matter exhibits in other
cases, they might think themselves authorized to
assume some peculiar power or agency, still material,
and thus they would have the hypothesis of a <i>Vital
Fluid</i>. And if they were driven to reject this, they
might think that there was no resource but to assume
an immaterial principle of life, and thus they would
arrive at the doctrine of an <i>Animal Soul</i>.</p>
<p>Now, through the cycle of hypotheses which we
have thus supposed, physiology has actually passed.
The conclusions to which the most philosophical minds
have been led by a survey of this progress is, that by
the failure of all these theories, men have exhausted
this path of inquiry, and shown that scientific truth is
to be sought in some other manner. But before I
proceed further to illustrate this result, it will be
proper, as I have already stated, to exhibit historically
the various hypotheses which I have described. In
doing this I shall principally follow the <i>History of
Medicine</i> of Sprengel. It is only by taking for my
guide a physiologist of acknowledged science and judgment, that I can hope, on such a subject, to avoid
errours of detail. I proceed now to give in succession
an account of the Mystical, the Iatrochemical, the
Iatromathematical, and the Vital-Fluid Schools; and
finally of the Psychical School, who hold the Vital
Powers to be derived from the Soul (<i>Psyche</i>).</p>

<h4 id="b9c2s1"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> I.&#8212;<i>The Mystical School.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> order to abbreviate as much as can conveniently
be done the historical view which I have now to
take, I shall altogether pass over the physiological
speculations of the ancients, and begin my survey with
the general revival of science in modern times.</p>
<p>We need not dwell long on the fantastical and unsubstantial doctrines concerning physiology which prevailed in the sixteenth century, and which flowed in a
great measure from the fertile but ill-regulated imaginations of the cultivators of Alchemy and Magic. One
of the prominent doctors of this school is the celebrated
Paracelsus, whose doctrines contained a combination
of biblical interpretations, visionary religious notions,
fanciful analogies, and bold experiments in practical
medicine. The opinion of a close but mystical resemblance of parts between the universe and the human
body,&#8212;the <i>Macrocosm</i> and the <i>Microcosm</i>,&#8212;as these
two things, thus compared, were termed, had probably
come down from the Neoplatonists; it was adopted by
the Paracelsists<a id="fnanchor1-9" href="#note1-9"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>, and connected with various astrological dreams and cabbalistic riddles. A succession
of later Paracelsists<a id="fnanchor2-9" href="#note2-9"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>, Rosicrucians, and other fanatics
of the same kind, continued into the seventeenth century. Upon their notions was founded the pretension
of curing wounds by a sympathetic powder, which Sir
Kenelm Digby, among others, asserted; while animal
magnetism, and the transfer of diseases from one person to another<a id="fnanchor3-9" href="#note3-9"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>, were maintained by others of this <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page175">175</a></span> school. They held, too, the doctrines of <i>astral bodies</i>
corresponding to each terrestrial body; and of the <i>signatures</i> of plants, that is, certain features in their external form by which their virtues might be known.
How little advantage or progress real physiology could
derive from speculations of this kind may be seen from
this, that their tendency was to obliterate the distinction between living and lifeless things: according to
Paracelsus, all things are alive, eat, drink, and excrete;
even minerals and fluids<a id="fnanchor4-9" href="#note4-9"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>. According to him and his
school, besides material and immaterial beings, there
are <i>elementary Spirit</i>s which hold an intermediate place,
<i>Sylvans</i>, <i>Nymphs</i>, <i>Gnomes</i>, <i>Salamanders</i>, &amp;c. by whose
agency various processes of enchantment may be
achieved, and things apparently supernatural explained.
Thus this spiritualist scheme dealt with a world of its
own by means of fanciful inventions and mystical visions, instead of making any step in the study of nature.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-9" href="#fnanchor1-9">1</a></span> Spr. iii. 456.</div>

<p>Perhaps, however, one of the most fantastical of the
inventions of Paracelsus may be considered as indicating a perception of a peculiar character in the vital
powers. According to him, the business of digestion
is performed by a certain demon whom he calls <i>Archæus</i>, who has his abode in the stomach, and who, by
means of his alchemical processes, separates the nutritive from the harmful part of our food, and makes it
capable of assimilation<a id="fnanchor5-9" href="#note5-9"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>. This fanciful notion was
afterwards adopted and expanded by Van Helmont<a id="fnanchor6-9" href="#note6-9"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>.
According to him the stomach and spleen are both
under the direction of this Master-spirit, and these
two organs form a sort of <i>Duumvirate</i> in the body.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-9" href="#fnanchor5-9">5</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> iii. 468.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-9" href="#fnanchor6-9">6</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> iv. 302.</div>
<p>But though we may see in such writers occasional
gleams of physiological thought, the absence of definite
physical relations in the speculations thus promulgated was necessarily intolerable to men of sound
understanding and scientific tendencies. Such men
naturally took hold of that part of the phenomena of
life which could be most distinctly conceived, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page176">176</a></span> which could be apparently explained by means of the
sciences then cultivated; and this was the part which
appeared to be reducible to chemical conceptions and
doctrines. It will readily be supposed that the processes of chemistry have a considerable bearing upon
physiological processes, and might, till their range was
limited by a sound investigation, be supposed to have
still more than they really had; and thus a Physiology
was formed which depended mainly upon Chemistry,
and the school which held this doctrine has been called
the <i>Iatrochemical</i> School.</p>
<h4 id="b9c2s2"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.&#8212;<i>The Iatrochemical School.</i></h4>
<p>That all physical properties, and therefore chemical
relations, have a material influence on physiological
results, was already recognized, though dimly, in the
Galenic doctrine of the ‘four elementary qualities.’
But at the time of Paracelsus, chemical action was
more distinctly than before separated from other kinds
of physical action; and therefore a physiological doctrine,
founded upon chemistry, and freed from the extravagance and mysticism of the Paracelsists, was a very
promising path of speculation. Andrew Libavius<a id="fnanchor7-9" href="#note7-9"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> of
Halle, in Saxony, Physician and Teacher in the Gymnasium at Koberg, is pointed out by Sprengel as the
person who began to cultivate chemistry, as distinct
from the theosophic fantasies of his predecessors; and
Angelus Sala of Vienna<a id="fnanchor8-9" href="#note8-9"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>, as his successor. The latter
has the laudable distinction of having rejected the prevalent conceits about a potable gold, a universal medicine, and the like<a id="fnanchor9-9" href="#note9-9"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a>. In Germany already at the beginning of the seventeenth century a peculiar chair of
<i>Chymiatria</i> was already created at Marpurg: and
many in various places pursued the same studies, till,
in the middle of the seventeenth century, we come to
Lemery<a id="fnanchor10-9" href="#note10-9"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>, the principal reformer of pharmaceutical
chemistry. But we are not here so much concerned <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page177">177</a></span> with the practical as with the theoretical parts of
Iatrochemistry; and hence we pass on to Sylvius<a id="fnanchor11-9" href="#note11-9"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> and
his system.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-9" href="#fnanchor7-9">7</a></span> Spr. iii. 550.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-9" href="#fnanchor8-9">8</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> iv. 281.</div>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-9" href="#fnanchor11-9">11</a></span> Spr. iv. 336.</div>
<p>The opinion that chemistry had an important bearing upon physiology did not, however, begin with Sylvius. Paracelsus, among his extravagant absurdities,
did some service to medicine by drawing attention to
this important truth. He used<a id="fnanchor12-9" href="#note12-9"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> chemical principles
for the explanation of particular diseases: most or all
diseases according to him, arise from the effervescence
of salts, from the combustion of sulphur, or from the
coagulation of mercury. His medicines were chemical
preparations; and it was<a id="fnanchor13-9" href="#note13-9"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a> an undeniable advantage of
the Paracelsian doctrine that chemistry thus became
indispensable to the physician. We still retain a remnant of the chemical nomenclature of Paracelsus in the
term <i>tartar</i>, denoting the stony concretion which forms
on the teeth<a id="fnanchor14-9" href="#note14-9"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>. According to him there is a certain
substance, the basis of all diseases which arise from a
thickening of the juices and a collection of earthy
matter; and this substance he calls <i>Tartarus</i>, because
‘it burns like the fire of hell.’ Helmont, the successor
of Paracelsus in many absurdities, also followed him in
the attempt to give a chemical account, however loose
and wild, of the functions of the human body; and is
by Sprengel considered, with all his extravagancies, as
a meritorious and important discoverer. The notion
of the fermentation of fluids<a id="fnanchor15-9" href="#note15-9"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a>, and of the aërial product thence resulting, to which he gave the name of
<i>Gas</i>, forms an important part of his doctrines; and of
the six digestions which he assumes, the <i>first</i> prepares
an acid, which is neutralized by the gall when it
reaches the duodenum, and this constitutes the <i>second</i>
digestion.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-9" href="#fnanchor15-9">15</a></span> Vol. v. 315.</div>
<p>I have already, in the History of Chemistry<a id="fnanchor16-9" href="#note16-9"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>, stated,
that the doctrine of the opposition of acid and alkali,
the great step which theoretical chemistry owes to
Sylvius, was first brought into view as a physiological <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page178">178</a></span> tenet, although we had then to trace its consequences
in another science. The explanation of all the functions of the animal system, both healthy and morbid,
by means of this and other chemical doctrines, and the
prescription of methods of cure founded upon such explanations, form the scheme of the <i>iatrochemical</i> school;
a school which almost engrossed the favour of European
physicians during the greater part of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-9" href="#fnanchor16-9">16</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xiii. c. 2.</div>
<p>Sylvius taught medicine at Leyden, from the year
1658, with so much success, that Boerhaave alone surpassed him<a id="fnanchor17-9" href="#note17-9"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a>. His notions, although he piqued himself on their originality, were manifestly suggested in
no small degree (as all such supposed novelties are) by
the speculations of his predecessors, and the spirit of
the times. Like Helmont<a id="fnanchor18-9" href="#note18-9"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>, he considers digestion as
consisting in a fermentation; but he states it more
definitely as the effervescence of an acid, supplied by
the saliva and the pancreatic juice, with the alkali of
the gall. By various other hypothetical processes, all
of a chemical nature, the blood becomes a collection of
various juices, which are the subjects of the speculations of the iatrochemists, to the entire neglect of the
solid parts of the body. Diseases were accounted for
by a supposed prevalence of one or the other of the
acrid principles, the acid or the alkaline: and Sylvius<a id="fnanchor19-9" href="#note19-9"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>
was bold enough to found upon these hypotheses practical methods of cure, which were in the highest
degree mischievous.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-9" href="#fnanchor17-9">17</a></span> Spr. iv. 336.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-9" href="#fnanchor18-9">18</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> 338.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-9" href="#fnanchor19-9">19</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> iv. 345.</div>
<p>The Sylvian doctrine was often combined with some
of the notions of the Cartesian system of philosophy;
but this mixture I shall not notice, since my present
object is to trace the history of a mere chemical
physiology as one of the unsuccessful attempts at a
philosophy of life. With various modifications, this
doctrine was diffused over Europe. It gave rise to
several controversies, which turned upon the questions
of the novelty of the doctrine, and the use of chemical
remedies to which it pointed, as well as upon its <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page179">179</a></span> theoretical truth. We need not dwell long upon these
controversies, although they were carried on with no
small vehemence in their time. Thus the school of
Paris opposed all innovation, remained true to the
Galenic dogmatism, and declared itself earnestly against
all combination of chemistry with medicine; and even
against the chemical preparation of medicaments.
Guy Patin, a celebrated and learned professor of that
day, declares<a id="fnanchor20-9" href="#note20-9"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a> that the chemists are no better than
forgers, and ought to be punished as such. The use
of antimonial medicines was a main point of dispute
between the iatrochemists and their opponents; Patin
maintained that more men had been destroyed by
antimony than by the thirty years’ war of Germany;
and endeavoured to substantiate this assertion by collecting all such cases in his <i>Martyrologium Antimonii</i>.
It must have been a severe blow to Patin when<a id="fnanchor21-9" href="#note21-9"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> in
1666, the Doctors of the Faculty of Paris, assembled
by command of the parliament, declared, by a majority
of ninety-two voices, that the use of antimonial medicines was allowable and laudable, and when all attempts to set aside this decision failed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-9" href="#fnanchor21-9">21</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> iv. 350.</div>
<p>Florentius Schuyl of Leyden sought to recommend
the iatrochemical doctrines, by maintaining that they
were to be found in the Hippocratic writings; nor
was it difficult to give a chemical interpretation of the
humoral pathology of the ancients. The Italian<a id="fnanchor22-9" href="#note22-9"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> physicians also, for the most part, took this line, and
attempted to show the agreement of the principles of
the ancient school of medicine with the new chemical
notions. This, indeed, is the usual manner in which
the diffusion of new theoretical ideas becomes universal.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-9" href="#fnanchor22-9">22</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> 368.</div>
<p>The progress of the chemical school of medicine in
England<a id="fnanchor23-9" href="#note23-9"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> requires our more especial notice. Willis
was the most celebrated champion of this sect. He
assumed, but with modifications of his own, the three
Paracelsian principles, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury;
considered digestion as the effect of an acid, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page180">180</a></span> explained other parts of the animal economy by distillation, fermentation, and the like. All diseases arise
from the want of the requisite <i>ferment</i>; and the physician, he says<a id="fnanchor24-9" href="#note24-9"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>, may be compared to a vintner, since
both the one and the other have to take care that the
necessary fermentations go on, that no foreign matter
mixes itself with the wine of life, to interrupt or derange those operations. In the middle of the seventeenth century, medicine had reached a point in which
the life of the animal body was considered as merely a
chemical process; the wish to explain everything on
known principles left no recognized difference between
organized and unorganized bodies, and diseases were
treated according to this delusive notion. The condition of chemistry itself during this period, though not
one of brilliant progress, was sufficiently stable and
flourishing to give a plausibility to any speculation
which was founded on chemical principles; and the
real influence of these principles in the animal frame
could not be denied.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-9" href="#fnanchor23-9">23</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> 353.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-9" href="#fnanchor24-9">24</a></span> Spr. 354.</div>
<p>The iatrochemists were at first resisted, as we have
seen, by the adherents of the ancient schools; they
were attacked on various grounds, and finally deposed
from them ascendancy by another sect, which we have
to speak of, as the iatromathematical, or mechanical
school. This sect was no less unsatisfactory and erroneous in its positive doctrines than the chemists had
been; for the animal frame is no more a mere machine than a mere laboratory: but it promoted the
cause of truth, by detecting and exposing the insufficient explanations and unproved assertions of the reigning theory.</p>
<p>Boyle was one of the persons who first raised doubts
against the current chemical doctrines of his time, as
we have elsewhere noted; but his objections had no
peculiar physiological import. Herman Coming<a id="fnanchor25-9" href="#note25-9"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>, the
most learned physician of his time, a contemporary
with Sylvius, took a view more pertinent to our present object; for he not only rejected the alchemical <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page181">181</a></span> and hermetical medicines, but taught expressly that
chemistry, in its then existing condition, was better
fitted to be of use in the practice of pharmacy, than in
the theories of physiology and pathology. He made the
important assertion, also, that chemical principles do
not pre-exist <em>as such</em> in the animal body; and that
there are higher powers which operate in the organic
world, and which do not depend on the form and mixture of matter.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-9" href="#fnanchor25-9">25</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> iv. 361.</div>
<p>Attempts were made to prove the acid and alkaline
nature of the fluids of the human body by means of
experiments, as by John Viridet of Geneva<a id="fnanchor26-9" href="#note26-9"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>, and by
Raimond Vieussens<a id="fnanchor27-9" href="#note27-9"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>, the latter of whom maintained
that he had extracted an acid from the blood, and detected a ferment in the stomach. In opposition to him,
Hecquet, a disciple of the iatromathematical school,
endeavoured to prove that digestion was performed, not
by means of fermentation, but by trituration. Hecquet’s own opinions cannot be defended; but his objections to the chemical doctrines, and his assertion of

<p>The most important opponents of the iatrochemical
school were Pitcairn in England, Bohn and Hoffman
in Germany, and Boerhaave in Holland. These eminent physicians, about the end of the seventeenth
century, argued on the same grounds of observation,
that digestion is not fermentation, and that the Sylvian
accounts of the origin of diseases by means of acid and
alkali are false. The arguments and authority of these
and other persons finally gained an ascendancy in the
medical world, and soon after this period we may consider the reign of the chemical school of physiology as
past. In fact, the attempts to prove its assertions experimentally were of the feeblest kind, and it had no
solid basis on which it could rest, so as to resist the
shock of the next hypothesis which the progress of
the physical sciences might impel against it. We
may, therefore, now consider the opinion of the mere <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page182">182</a></span> chemical nature of the vital processes as disproved,
and we proceed next to notice the history of another
unsuccessful essay to reduce vital actions to known
actions of another kind.</p>
<h4 id="b9c2s3"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> III.&#8212;<i>The Iatromathematical School.</i></h4>
<p>In the first Section of this chapter, we enumerated
the biological hypotheses which at first present themselves, as the mystical, the mechanical, the chemical.
We might have expected that they should occur to
men’s minds in the order thus stated: and in fact they
did so; for the physiology of the ancient materialists,
as Democritus and Lucretius, is mechanical so far as it
is at all distinct in its views, and thus the mechanical
preceded the chemical doctrine. But in modern times,
the fluid or chemical physiology was developed before
the solid or mechanical: of which the reason appears
to have been this;&#8212;that Mechanics and Chemistry
began to assume a scientific character about the same
time; and that of the two, Chemistry not only appeared at first sight more applicable to the functions
of the body, because all the more rapid changes appear
to be connected with modifications of the fluids of the
animal system, but also, by its wider range of facts
and more indefinite principles, afforded a better temporary refuge for the mind when perplexed by the
difficulties and mysteries which spring out of the speculations concerning life. But if Chemistry was thus
at first a more inviting field for the physiologist, Mechanics soon became more attractive in virtue of the
splendid results obtained by the schools of Galileo and
Newton. And when the insufficiency of chemical
physiology was discovered by trial, as we have seen it
was, the hope naturally arose, that the mechanical
principles which had explained so many of the phenomena of the external universe might also be found,
applicable to the smaller world of material life;&#8212;that
the <em>microcosm</em> as well as the <em>macrocosm</em> might have
its mechanical principles. From this hope sprung the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page183">183</a></span> Iatromathematical School, or school of Mechanical
Physiologists.</p>
<p>We may, however, divide this school into two parts,
the Italian, and the Cartesio-Newtonian sect. The
former employed themselves in calculating and analysing a number of the properties of the animal frame
which are undoubtedly mechanical; the latter, somewhat intoxicated by the supposed triumphs of the
corpuscular philosophy, endeavoured to extend these
to physiology, and for this purpose introduced into the
subject many arbitrary and baseless hypotheses. I will
very briefly mention some of the writers of both these
sects.</p>
<p>The main points to which the Italian or genuine
Mechanical Physiologists attended, were the application of mechanical calculations to the force of the
muscles, and of hydraulical reasonings to the motion
of the fluids of the animal system. The success with
which Galileo and his disciples had pursued these
branches of mechanical philosophy, and the ascendancy
which they had obtained, first in Italy, and then in
other lands, made such speculations highly interesting.
Borelli may be considered as the first great name in
his line, and his book, <i>De Motu Animalium</i>, (<i>Opus
Posthumum</i>, Romæ, 1680,) is even now a very instructive treatise on the forces and action of the bones and
muscles. This, certainly one of the most valuable
portions of mechanical physiology, has not even yet
been so fully developed as it deserves, although John
Bernoulli<a id="fnanchor29-9" href="#note29-9"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a> and his son Daniel<a id="fnanchor30-9" href="#note30-9"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> applied to it the
resources of analysis, and Pemberton<a id="fnanchor31-9" href="#note31-9"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a> in England,
pursued the same subject. Other of these mechanico-physiological problems consisted in referring the pressure of the blood and of the breath to hydrostatical
principles. In this manner Borelli was led to assert
that the muscles of the heart exert a force of 180,000
pounds<a id="fnanchor32-9" href="#note32-9"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a>. But a little later, Keill reduced this force <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page184">184</a></span> to a few ounces<a id="fnanchor33-9" href="#note33-9"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a>. Keill and others attempted to
determine, on similar principles, the velocity of the
blood; we need not notice the controversies which thus
arose, since there is not involved in them any peculiar
physiological principle.</p>

<p>The peculiar character of the iatromathematical
school, as an attempt at physiological theory, is more
manifest in its other section, which we have called the
Cartesio-Newtonian. The Cartesian system pretended
to account for the appearances and changes of bodies
by means of the size, figure, and motion of their minute
particles. And though this system in its progress towards the intellectual empire of Europe was suddenly
overturned by the rise of the Newtonian philosophy,
these corpuscular doctrines rather gained than lost by
the revolution; for the Newtonian philosophy enlarged
the powers of the corpuscular hypothesis, by adding
the effects of the attractive and repulsive forces of
particles to those of their form and motion. By this
means, although Newton’s discoveries did not in fact
augment the probability of the corpuscular hypothesis,
they so far increased its plausibility, that this hypothesis found favour both with Newton himself and his
contemporaries, no less than it had done with the
Cartesians.</p>
<p>The attempt to apply this corpuscular hypothesis to
physiology was made by Des Cartes himself. The
general character of such speculations may easily be
guessed<a id="fnanchor34-9" href="#note34-9"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a>. The secretions are effected by the organs
operating after the manner of sieves. Bound particles
pass through cylindrical tubes, pyramidal ones through
triangular pores, cubical particles through square apertures, and thus different kinds of matter are separated.
Similar speculations were pursued by other mathematicians: the various diameter of the vessels<a id="fnanchor35-9" href="#note35-9"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a>, their
curvatures, folds, and angles, were made subjects of
calculation. Bellini, Donzellini, Gulielmini, in Italy;
Perrault, Dodart, in France; Cole, Keill, Jurin, in
England, were the principal cultivators of such studies. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page185">185</a></span> In the earlier part of the eighteenth century, physiological theorists considered it as almost self-evident
that their science required them to reason concerning
the size and shape of the particles of the fluids, the
diameter and form of the invisible vessels. Such was,
for instance, the opinion of Cheyne<a id="fnanchor36-9" href="#note36-9"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a>, who held that
acute fevers arise from the obstruction of the glands,
which occasions a more vehement motion of the blood.
Mead, the physician of the King, and the friend of
Newton, in like manner explained the effects of poisons
by hypotheses concerning the form of their particles<a id="fnanchor37-9" href="#note37-9"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a>,
as we have already seen in speaking of chemistry.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to dwell longer on this
subject, or to point out the total insufficiency of the
mere mechanical physiology. The iatrochemists had
neglected the effect of the solids of the living frame;
the iatromathematicians attended only to these<a id="fnanchor38-9" href="#note38-9"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a>. And
even these were considered only as canals, as cords, as
levers, as lifeless machines. These reasoners never
looked for any powers of a higher order than the cohesion, the resistance, the gravity, the attraction, which
operate in inert matter. If the chemical school assimilated the physician to a vintner or brewer, the
mechanical physiologists made him an hydraulic engineer; and, in fact, several of the iatromathematicians
were at the same time teachers of engineering and of
medicine.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-9" href="#fnanchor38-9">38</a></span> Spr. iv. 419.</div>
<p>Several of the reasoners of this school combined chemical with their mechanical principles; but it would
throw no additional light upon the subject to give any
account of these, and I shall therefore go on to speak
of the next form of the attempt to explain the processes of life.</p>
<h4 id="b9c2s4"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> IV.&#8212;<i>The Vital-Fluid School.</i></h4>
<p>I speak here, not of that opinion which assumes
some kind of fluid or ether as the means of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page186">186</a></span> communication along the <em>nerves</em> in particular, but of the hypothesis that <em>all</em> the peculiar functions of <em>life</em> depend
upon some subtile ethereal substance diffused through
the frame;&#8212;not of a <em>Nervous</em> Fluid, but of a <em>Vital</em>
Fluid. Again, I distinguish this opinion from the
doctrine of an <em>immaterial</em> vital power or principle, an
Animal Soul, which will be the subject of the next
<a href="#b9c2s5">Section</a>: nor is this distinction insignificant; for a
material element, however subtile, however much spiritualized, must still act everywhere according to the
same laws; whereas we do not conceive an immaterial
spirit or soul to be subject to this necessity.</p>
<p>The iatromathematical school could explain to their
own satisfaction how motions, once begun, were transferred and modified; but in many organs of the living
frame there seemed to be a power of beginning motion,
which is beyond all mere mechanical action. This led
to the assumption of a Principle of a higher kind,
though still material. Such a Principle was asserted
by Frederick Hoffmann, who was born at Halle, in
1660<a id="fnanchor39-9" href="#note39-9"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a>, and became Professor of Medicine at the newly
established University there in 1694. According to
him<a id="fnanchor40-9" href="#note40-9"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a>, the reason of the greater activity of organized
bodies lies in the influence of a material substance of
extreme subtilty, volatility, and energy. This is, he
holds, no other than the Ether, which, diffused through
all nature, produces in plants the bud, the secretion
and motion of the juices, and is separated from the
blood and lodged in the brain of animals<a id="fnanchor41-9" href="#note41-9"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a>. From this,
acting through the nerves, must be derived all the
actions of the organs in the animal frame; for when
the influence of the nerve upon the muscle ceases,
muscular motion ceases also.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-9" href="#fnanchor39-9">39</a></span> Spr. v. 254.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note40-9" href="#fnanchor40-9">40</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> v. 257.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-9" href="#fnanchor41-9">41</a></span> <i>De Differentiâ Organismi et Mechanismi</i>, pp. 48, 67.</div>
<p>The mode of operation of this vital fluid was, however, by no means steadily apprehended by Hoffmann
and his followers. Its operations are so far mechanical<a id="fnanchor42-9" href="#note42-9"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> that all effects are reduced to motion, yet they <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page187">187</a></span> cannot be explained according to known mechanical
laws. At one time the effects are said to take place
according to laws of a Higher Mechanics which are
still to be discovered<a id="fnanchor43-9" href="#note43-9"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a>. At another time, in complete
contradiction of the general spirit of the system, metaphysical conceptions are introduced: each particle of
the vital fluid is said to have a determined <i>idea</i> of the
whole mechanism and organism<a id="fnanchor44-9" href="#note44-9"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a>, and according to this,
it forms the body and preserves it by its motion. By
means of this fluid the soul operates upon the body,
and the instincts and the passions have their source
in this material sensitive soul. This attribution of
ideas to the particles of the fluid is less unaccountable
when we recollect that something of the same kind is
admitted into Leibnitz’s system, whose Monads have
also ideas.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its inconsistencies, Hoffmann’s
system was received with very general favour both in
Germany and in the rest of Europe; the more so, inasmuch as it fell in very well with the philosophy both
of Leibnitz and of Newton. The Newtonians were
generally inclined to identify the Vital Fluid with the
Ether, of which their master was so strongly disposed
to assume the existence: and indeed he himself suggested this identification.</p>
<p>When the discoveries made respecting Electricity in
the course of the eighteenth century had familiarized
men with the notion of a pervading subtile agent,
invisible, intangible, yet producing very powerful
effects in every part of nature, physiologists also
caught at the suggestion of such an agent, and tried,
by borrowing or imitating it, to aid the imperfection
of their notions of the vital powers. The Vital Principle<a id="fnanchor45-9" href="#note45-9"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a> was imagined to be a substance of the same
kind, by some to be the same substance, with the
Electric Fluid. By its agency all these processes in
organized bodies were accounted for which cannot be <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page188">188</a></span> explained by mechanical or chemical laws, as the secretion of various matters (tears, milk, bile, &amp;c.) from
an homogeneous fluid, the blood; the production of
animal heat, digestion, and the like. According to
John Hunter, this attenuated substance pervaded the
blood itself, as well as the solid organic frame; and the
changes which take place in the blood which has
flowed out of the veins into a basin are explained by
saying that it is, for a time, till this vital fluid evaporates, truly alive.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-9" href="#fnanchor45-9">45</a></span> Prichard, <i>On the Doctrine of a Vital Principle</i>, p. 12.</div>
<p>The notion of a Vital Fluid appears also to be
favourably looked upon by Cuvier; although with him
this doctrine is mainly put forwards in the form of a
Nervous Fluid. Yet in the following passage he extends the operation of such an agent to all the vital
functions<a id="fnanchor46-9" href="#note46-9"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a>: ‘We have only to suppose that all the
medullary and nervous parts produce the Nervous
Agent, and that they alone conduct it; that is, that it
can only be transmitted by them, and that it is changed
or consumed by their actions. Then everything appears
simple. A detached portion of muscle preserves for
some time its irritability, on account of the portion of
nerve which always adheres to it. The sensibility and
the irritability reciprocally exhaust each other by their
exercise, because they change or consume the same
agent. All the interior motions of digestion, secretion, excretion, participate in this exhaustion, or may
produce it. All local excitation of the nerves brings
thither more blood by augmenting the irritability of
the arteries, and the afflux of blood augments the
real sensibility by augmenting the production of the
nervous agent. Hence the pleasures of titillations,
the pains of inflammation. The particular sensations
increase in the same manner and by the same causes;
and the imagination exercises, (still by means of the
nerves,) upon the internal fibres of the arteries or
other parts, and through them on the sensations, an
action analogous to that of the will upon the voluntary
motions. As each exterior sense is exclusively disposed <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page189">189</a></span> to admit the substances which it is to perceive, so each
interior organ, secretory or other, is also more excitable by some one agent than by another: and hence
arises what has been called the <i>proper sensibility</i> or
<i>proper life of the organs</i>; and the influence of specifics
which, introduced into the general circulation, affect
only certain parts. In fine, if the nervous agent cannot become sensible to us, the reason is that all sensation requires that this agent should be altered in some
way or other; and it cannot alter itself.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-9" href="#fnanchor46-9">46</a></span> <i>Hist. Sc. Nat. depuis</i> 1789, i. 214.</div>
<p>‘Such is the summary idea which we may at present
form of the mutual and general working of the vital
powers in animals.’</p>
<p>Against the doctrine of a Vital Fluid as one uniform
material agent pervading the organic frame, an argument has been stated which points out extremely well
the philosophical objection to such an hypothesis<a id="fnanchor47-9" href="#note47-9"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a>. If
the Vital Principle be the <em>same</em> in all parts of the
body, how does it happen, it is asked, that the secretions are so <em>different</em>? How do the particles in the
blood, separated from their old compounds and united
into new ones, under the same influence, give origin
to all the different fluids which are produced by the
glands? The liver secretes bile, the lacrymal gland,
tears, and so on. Is the Vital Principle different in
all these organs? To assert this, is to multiply nominal principles without limit, and without any advance
in the explanation of facts. Is the Vital Principle the
same, but its operation modified by the structure of
the organ? We have then two unknown causes, the
Vital Principle and the Organic Structure, to account,
for the effect. By such a multiplication of hypotheses
nothing is gained. We may as well say at once, that
the structure of the organ, acting by laws yet unknown,
is the cause of the peculiar secretion. It is as easy to
imagine this structure acting to produce the whole
effect, as it is to imagine it modifying the activity of
another agent. Thus the hypothesis of the Vital Fluid
in this form explains nothing, and does not in any <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page190">190</a></span> way help onwards the progress of real biological knowledge.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-9" href="#fnanchor47-9">47</a></span> Prichard, <i>On a Vital Principle</i>, p. 98.</div>
<p>The hypothesis of an <em>immaterial</em> vital principle must
now be considered.</p>
<h4 id="b9c2s5"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> V.&#8212;<i>The Psychical School.</i></h4>
<p>The doctrine of an Animal Soul as the principle
which makes the operations of organic different from
those of inorganic matter, is quite distinct from, and
we may say independent of, the doctrine of the soul as
the intelligent, moral, responsible part of man’s nature.
It is the former doctrine alone of which we have here
to speak, and those who thus hold the existence of an
immaterial agent as the cause of the phenomena of
life, I term the <i>Psychical School</i>.</p>
<p>Such a view of the constitution of living things is
very ancient. For instance, Aristotle’s Treatise ‘<i>On
the Soul</i>,’ goes entirely upon the supposition that the
Soul is the cause of motion, and he arrives at the conclusion that there are different <em>parts</em> in the Soul; the
<i>nutritive</i> or <i>vegetative</i>, the <i>sensitive</i>, and the <i>rational</i><a id="fnanchor48-9" href="#note48-9"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-9" href="#fnanchor48-9">48</a></span> Aristotle. Περὶ Ψυχῆς, ii. 2.</div>
<p>But this doctrine is more instructive to us, when it
appears as the antagonist of other opinions concerning
the nature of life. In this form it comes before us as
promulgated by Stahl, whom we have already noticed
as one of the great discoverers in chemistry. Born in
the same year as Hoffmann, and appointed at his suggestion professor at the same time in the same new
university of Halle, he soon published a rival physiological theory. In a letter to Lucas Schröck, the president of the Academy of Naturalists, he describes the
manner in which he was led to form a system for himself<a id="fnanchor49-9" href="#note49-9"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a>. Educated in the tenets of Sylvius and Willis,
according to which all diseases are derived from the
acidity of the fluids, Stahl, when a young student,
often wondered how these fluids, so liable to be polluted and corrupted, are so wonderfully preserved
through innumerable external influences, and seem to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page191">191</a></span> be far less affected by these than by age, constitution,
passion. No material cause could, he thought, produce such effects. No attention to mechanism or chemistry alone could teach us the true nature and laws of organization.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-9" href="#fnanchor49-9">49</a></span> Spr. v. 303.</div>
<p>So far as Stahl recognized the influence, in living
bodies, of something beyond the range of mechanics
and chemistry, there can be no doubt of the sound
philosophy of his views; but when he proceeds to
found a positive system of physiology, his tenets become more precarious. The basis of his theory is this<a id="fnanchor50-9" href="#note50-9"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a>:
the body has, as body, no power to move itself, and
must always be put in motion by immaterial substances. All motion is a spiritual act<a id="fnanchor51-9" href="#note51-9"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a>. The source of all activity in the organic body, from which its preservation, the permanency of its composition, and all
its other functions proceed, is an immaterial being,
which Stahl calls the <i>Soul</i>; because, as he says, when
the effects are so similar, he will not multiply powers
without necessity. Of this principle, he says, as the
Hippocratians said of Nature, that ‘it does without
teaching what it ought to do<a id="fnanchor52-9" href="#note52-9"><span class="fnanchor">52</span></a>,’ and does it ‘without
consideration<a id="fnanchor53-9" href="#note53-9"><span class="fnanchor">53</span></a>.’ These ancient tenets Stahl interprets
in such a manner that even the involuntary motions
proceed from the soul, though without reflection or
clear consciousness. It is indeed evident, that there
are many customary motions and sensations which are
perfectly rational, yet not the objects of distinct consciousness: and thus instinctive motions, and those of
which we are quite unconscious, may still be connected
with reason. The questions which in this view offer
themselves, as, how the soul passes from the mother to
the child, he dismisses as unprofitable<a id="fnanchor54-9" href="#note54-9"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a>. He considers
nutrition and secretion as the work of the soul. The
corpuscular theory and the doctrine of animal spirits <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page192">192</a></span> are, he rightly observes, mere hypotheses, which are
arbitrary in their character, and only shift the difficulty. For, if the animal spirits are not matter, how can they
explain the action of an immaterial substance on the body; and if they are matter, how are they themselves
acted on?</p>

<p>This doctrine of the action of the soul on the body,
was accepted by many persons, especially by the iatromathematicians, who could not but feel the insufficiency of their system without some such supplement:
such were Cheyne and Mead. In Germany, Stahl’s
disciples in physiology were for the most part inconsiderable persons<a id="fnanchor55-9" href="#note55-9"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a>. Several Englishmen who speculated concerning the metaphysics as well as the physiology of Sensation and Motion, inclined to this
psychical view, as Porterfield and Whytt. Among the
French, Boissier de Sauvages was the most zealous
defender of the Stahlian system. Actions, he says<a id="fnanchor56-9" href="#note56-9"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a>,
which belong to the preservation of life are determined
by a moral not a mechanical necessity. They proceed
from the soul, but cannot be controlled by it, as the
starting from fear, or the trembling at danger. Unzer,
a physician at Altona<a id="fnanchor57-9" href="#note57-9"><span class="fnanchor">57</span></a>, was also a philosophical Stahlian<a id="fnanchor58-9" href="#note58-9"><span class="fnanchor">58</span></a>.</p>

<p>We need not dwell on the opposition which was
offered to this theory, first by Hoffmann, and afterwards by Haller. The former of these had promulgated, as we have seen, the rival theory of a Nervous
Fluid, the latter was the principal assertor of the doctrine of Irritability, an important theory on which we
may afterwards have to touch. Haller’s animosity
against the Stahlian hypothesis is a remarkable feature
in one who is in general so tolerant in his judgment
of opinions. His arguments are taken from the absence of the control of the will over the vital actions,
from the want of consciousness accompanying these
actions, from the uniformity of them in different conditions of the mind, and from the small sensibility of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page193">193</a></span> the heart which is the source of the vital actions.
These objections, and the too decided distinction
which Haller made between voluntary and involuntary
muscles, were very satisfactorily answered by Whytt
and Platner. In particular it was urged that the instinctive actions of brutes are inexplicable by means of
mechanism, and may be compared with the necessary
vital actions of the human body. Neither kind are
accidental, neither kind are voluntary, both are performed without reflection.</p>
<p>Without tracing further the progress of the Psychical
Doctrine, I shall borrow a few reflections upon it from
Sprengel<a id="fnanchor59-9" href="#note59-9"><span class="fnanchor">59</span></a>:&#8212;</p>
<p>‘When the opponents of the Stahlian system repeat
incessantly that the assumption of a psychical cause in
corporeal effects is a metaphysical speculation which
does not belong to medicine, they talk to no purpose.
The states of the soul are objects of our internal experience, and interest the physician too nearly to allow
him to neglect them. The innumerable unconscious
efforts of the soul, the powerful and daily effects of the
passions upon the body, too often put to confusion
those who would expel into the region of metaphysics
the dispositions of the mind. The connexion of our
knowledge of the soul, as gathered from experience,
with our knowledge of the human body, is far closer
than the mechanical and chemical physiologists suspect.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note59-9" href="#fnanchor59-9">59</a></span> Spr. v. 383.</div>
<p>‘The strongest objection against the psychical system, and one which has never been sufficiently answered
by any of its advocates, is the universality of organic
effects in the <em>vegetable</em> kingdom. The comparison of
the physiology of plants with the physiology of animals
puts the latter in its true light. Without absolutely
trifling with the word <i>soul</i>, we cannot possibly derive
from a soul the organic operations of vegetables. But
just as little can we, as some Stahlians have done, draw
a sharp line between plants and animals, and ascribe
the processes of the former to mere mechanism, while <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page194">194</a></span> we derive the operations of the latter from an intellectual principle. Not to mention that such a line is not
possible, the rise of the sap and the alteration of the
fluids of plants cannot be derived entirely from material causes as their highest origin.’</p>
<p>Thus, I may add, this psychical theory, however difficult to defend in its detail, does in its generalities
express some important truths respecting the vital
powers. It not only, like the last theory, gives unity
to the living body, but it marks, more clearly than any
other theory, the wide interval which separates mechanical and chemical from vital action, and fixes our
attention upon the new powers which the consideration of life compels us to assume. It not only reminds
us that these powers are elevated above the known
laws of the material world, but also that they are
closely connected with the world of thought and feeling, of will and reason; and thus it carries us, in a
manner in which none of the preceding theories have
done, to a true conception of a living, conscious, sentient, active individual.</p>
<p>At the same time we cannot but allow that the life
of plants and of the lower orders of animals shows us
very clearly that, in order to arrive at any sound and
consistent knowledge respecting life, we must form
some conception of it from which all the higher attributes which the term ‘soul’ involves, are utterly and
carefully excluded; and therefore we cannot but come
to the conclusion that the psychical school are right
mainly in this; that in ascribing the functions of life
to a <em>soul</em>, they mark strongly and justly the impossibility of ascribing them to any known attributes of
<em>body</em>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Attempts to Analyse the Idea of Life.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b9c3s1">1. <i>Definitions of Life.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">We</span> have seen in the preceding chapter that all attempts to obtain a distinct
conception of the nature of Life in general have ended
in failure, and produced nothing beyond a negative
result. And the conjecture may now naturally occur,
that the cause of this failure resides in an erroneous
mode of propounding to ourselves the problem. Instead
of contemplating Life as a single Idea, it may perhaps
be proper to separate it into several component notions: instead of seeking for one cause of all vital
operations, it may be well to look at the separate vital
functions, and to seek their causes. When the view of
this possibility opens upon us, how shall we endeavour
to verify it, and to take advantage of it?</p>
<p>Let us, as one obvious course, take some of the
attempts which have been made to <i>define</i> Life, and let
us see whether they appear to offer to us any analysis
of the idea into component parts. Such definitions,
when they proceed from men of philosophical minds,
are the ultimate result of a long course of thought and
observation; and by no means deserve to be slighted
as arbitrary selections of conditions, or empty forms
of words.</p>
<p id="b9c3s2">2. Life has been defined by Stahl<a id="fnanchor60-9" href="#note60-9"><span class="fnanchor">60</span></a>, ‘The condition by which a body resists a natural tendency to
chemical changes, such as putrefaction.’ In like manner, M. von Humboldt<a id="fnanchor61-9" href="#note61-9"><span class="fnanchor">61</span></a> defines living bodies to be
‘those which, notwithstanding the constant operation <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page196">196</a></span> of causes tending to change their form, are hindered
by a certain inward power from undergoing such
change.’ The first of these definitions amounts only to
the assertion, that vital processes are not chemical; a
negative result, which we may accept as true, but
which is, as we have seen, a barren truth. The second
appears to be, in its import, identical with the first.
An <em>inward</em> principle can only be understood as distinguished from known external powers, such as mechanical and chemical agencies. Or if, by an internal
principle, we mean such a principle as that of which
we are <em>conscious</em> within ourselves, we ascribe a soul
to all living things: an hypothesis which we have seen
is not more effective than the former in promoting the
progress of biological science. Nearly the same criticism applies to such definitions as that of Kant: that
‘Life is an internal faculty producing change, motion,
and action.’</p>

<p>Other definitions refer us, not to some property
residing in the whole of an organized mass, but to the
connexion and relation of its parts. Thus M. von
Humboldt<a id="fnanchor62-9" href="#note62-9"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a> has given another definition of a living
body: that ‘it is a whole whose parts, arbitrarily separated, no longer resist chemical changes.’ But this
additional assertion concerning the parts, adds nothing
of any value to the definition of the whole. And in
some of the lower kinds of plants and animals it is
hardly true as a fact.</p>

<p id="b9c3s3">3. Another definition<a id="fnanchor63-9" href="#note63-9"><span class="fnanchor">63</span></a> places the character of Life
in ‘motions serviceable to the body moved.’ To this it
has been objected<a id="fnanchor64-9" href="#note64-9"><span class="fnanchor">64</span></a>, that, on this definition, the earth
and the planets are living bodies. Perhaps it would
be more philosophical to object to the introduction of
so loose a notion as that of a property being <i>serviceable</i>
to a body. We might also add, that if we speak of all
vital functions as <i>motions</i>, we make an assumption quite
unauthorized, and probably false.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note63-9" href="#fnanchor63-9">63</a></span> Erhard, Röschlaub’s <i>Magazin der Heilkunde</i>, b. i. st. 1. p. 69.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note64-9" href="#fnanchor64-9">64</a></span> Treviranus, <i>Biologie</i>, p. 41.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page197">197</a></span> Other definitions refer the idea of Life to the idea of
Organization. ‘Life is the activity of matter according
to laws of organization<a id="fnanchor65-9" href="#note65-9"><span class="fnanchor">65</span></a>.’ We are then naturally led to
ask, What is Organization? In reply to this is given us
the Kantian definition of Organization, which I have
already quoted elsewhere<a id="fnanchor66-9" href="#note66-9"><span class="fnanchor">66</span></a>, ‘An organized product of
nature is that in which all the parts are mutually
ends and means<a id="fnanchor67-9" href="#note67-9"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a>.’ That this definition involves exact
fundamental ideas, and is capable of being made the
basis of sound knowledge, I shall hereafter endeavour
to show. But I may observe that such a definition
leads us somewhat further. If the parts of organized
bodies are known to be means to certain ends, this
must be known because they fulfil these ends, and produce certain effects by the operation of a certain cause
or causes. The question then recurs, what is <em>the cause</em>
which produces such effects as take place in organized
or living bodies? and this is identical with the problem
of which in the last chapter we traced the history, and
related the failure of physiologists in all attempts at its
solution.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note65-9" href="#fnanchor65-9">65</a></span> Schmid, <i>Physiologie</i>, b. ii. p. 274.</div>

<p id="b9c3s4">4. But what has been just said suggests to us
that it may be an improvement to put our problem in
another shape:&#8212;not to take for granted that the cause
of all vital processes is one, but to suppose that there
may be several separate causes at work in a living
body. If this be so, life is no longer one kind of activity, but several. We have a number of operations
which are somehow bound together, and life is the
totality of all these: in short, life is not one Function,
but a System of Functions.</p>
<p id="b9c3s5">5. We are thus brought very near to the celebrated definition of life given by Bichat<a id="fnanchor68-9" href="#note68-9"><span class="fnanchor">68</span></a>: ‘Life is the
sum of the functions by which death is resisted.’ But
upon the definition thus stated, we may venture to
observe;&#8212;first, that the introduction of the notion of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page198">198</a></span> <em>death</em> in order to define the notion of <em>life</em> appears to be
unphilosophical. We may more naturally define death
with reference to life, as the cessation of life; or at
least we may consider life and death as correlative and
interdependent notions. Again, the word ‘sum,’ used
in the way in which it here occurs, appears to be likely
to convey an erroneous conception, as if the functions
here spoken of were simply added to each other, and
connected by co-existence. It is plain that our idea of
life involves more than this: the functions are all
clearly connected, and mutually depend on each other;
nutrition, circulation, locomotion, reproduction,&#8212;each
has its influence upon all the others. These functions
not merely co-exist, but exist with many mutual relations and connexions; they are continued so as to
form, not merely a <em>sum</em>, but a <em>system</em>. And thus we
are led to modify Bichat’s definition, and to say that
<em>Life is the system of vital functions</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-9" href="#fnanchor68-9">68</a></span> <i>Physiological Researches on Life and Death</i>.</div>
<p id="b9c3s6">6. But it will be objected that by such a definition
we explain nothing: the notion of <i>vital functions</i>, it
may be said, involves the idea of <i>life</i>, and thus brings
us round again to our starting-point. Or if not, at
least it is as necessary to define Vital Functions as to
define Life itself, so that we have made little progress
in our task.</p>
<p>To this we reply, that if any one seeks, upon such
subjects, some ultimate and independent definition
from which he can, by mere reasoning, deduce a series
of conclusions, he seeks that which cannot be found.
In the Inductive Sciences, a Definition does not form
the basis of reasoning, <em>but points out the course of investigation</em>. The definition must include words; and
the meaning of these words must be sought in the progress and results of observations, as I have elsewhere
said<a id="fnanchor69-9" href="#note69-9"><span class="fnanchor">69</span></a>. ‘The meaning of words is to be sought in the
progress of thought; the history of science is our dictionary; the steps of scientific induction are our definitions.’ It will appear, I think, that it is more easy
for us to form an idea of a separate Function of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page199">199</a></span> animal frame, as Nutrition or Reproduction, than to
comprehend Life in general under any single idea.
And when we say that Life is a system of Vital Functions, we are of course directed to study these functions separately, and (as in all other subjects of scientific research) to endeavour to form of them such clear
and definite ideas as may enable us to discover their
laws.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note69-9" href="#fnanchor69-9">69</a></span>  <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xiii. c. ix.</div>
<p id="b9c3s7">7. The view to which we are thus led, of the most
promising mode of conducting the researches of Biology, is one which the greatest and most philosophical
physiologists of modern times have adopted. Thus
Cuvier considers this as the true office of physiology
at present. ‘It belongs to modern times,’ he says, ‘to
form a just classification of the vital phenomena; the
task of the present time is to analyse the forces which
belong to each organic element, and upon the zeal and
activity which are given to this task, depends, according to my judgment, the fortune of physiology<a id="fnanchor70-9" href="#note70-9"><span class="fnanchor">70</span></a>.’ This
classification of the phenomena of life involves, of
course, a distinction and arrangement of the vital
functions; and the investigation of the powers by
which these functions are carried on, is a natural
sequel to such a classification.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note70-9" href="#fnanchor70-9">70</a></span> <i>Hist. Sc. Nat. dep.</i> 1789, i. 218.</div>
<p id="b9c3s8">8. <i>Classification of Functions.</i>&#8212;Attempts to classify the Vital Functions of man were made at an
early period, and have been repeated in great number
up to modern times. The task of classification is exposed to the same difficulties, and governed by the
same conditions, in this as in other subjects. Here, as
in the case of other things, there may be many classifications which are moderately good and natural, but
there is only one which is the best and the true natural system. Here, as in other cases, one classification
brings into view one set of relations; another, another;
and each may be valuable for its special purpose.
Here, as in other cases, the classes may be well constituted, though the boundary lines which divide them
be somewhat indistinct, and the order doubtful. Here, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page200">200</a></span> as in other cases, we may have approached to the natural classification without having attained it; and here,
as in other cases, to <em>define</em> our classes is the last and
hardest of our problems.</p>
<p id="b9c3s9">9. The most ancient classification of the Functions
of living things<a id="fnanchor71-9" href="#note71-9"><span class="fnanchor">71</span></a>, is the division of them into <i>Vital</i>,
<i>Natural</i>, and <i>Animal</i>. The Vital Functions are those
which cannot be interrupted without loss of life, as
<i>Circulation</i>, <i>Respiration</i>, and <i>Nervous Communication</i>.
The <i>Natural Functions</i> are those which without the
intervention of the will operate on their proper occasions to preserve the bodies of animals; they are <i>Digestion</i>, <i>Absorption</i>, <i>Nutrition</i>; to which was added
<i>Generation</i>. The <i>Animal</i> Functions are those which
involve perception and will, by which the animal is
distinguished from the vegetable; they are <i>Sensibility</i>,
<i>Locomotion</i>, and <i>Voice</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note71-9" href="#fnanchor71-9">71</a></span> <i>Dict. des Sciences Nat.</i> art. <i>Fonctions</i>.</div>
<p>The two great grounds of this division, the distinction of functions which operate continually, and those
which operate occasionally; and again, the distinction
of functions which involve sensation and voluntary
motion from those which do not; are truly of fundamental importance, and gave a real value to this classification. It was, however, liable to obvious objections:
namely, <i>First</i>, that the names of the classes were ill
chosen; for all the functions are natural, all are vital:
<i>Second</i>, that the lines of demarcation between the
classes are indefinite and ambiguous; Respiration is a
<i>vital</i> function, as being continually necessary to life;
but it is also a <i>natural</i> function, since it occurs in the
formation of the nutritive fluid, and an <i>animal</i> function, since it depends in part on the will. But these
objections were not fatal, for a classification may be
really sound and philosophical, though its boundary
lines are vague, and its nomenclature ill selected. The
division of the functions we have mentioned kept its
ground long; or was employed with a subdivision of
one class, so as to make them four; the <i>vital</i>, <i>natural</i>,
<i>animal</i> and <i>sexual</i> functions. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page201">201</a></span></p>
<p id="b9c3s10">10. I pass over many intermediate attempts to
classify the functions, and proceed to that of Bichat as
that which is, I believe, the one most generally assented to in modern times. The leading principle in
the scheme of this celebrated physiologist is the distinction between <em>organic</em> and <em>animal</em> life. This separation is nearly identical with the one just noticed
between the vital and animal functions; but Bichat,
by the contrasts which he pointed out between these
classes of functions, gave a decided prominence and
permanence to the distinction. The Organic Life,
which in animals is analogous to the life of vegetables,
and the Animal Life, which implies sensation and
voluntary motion, have each its system of organs.
The center of the animal life is the brain, of the organic
life, the heart. The former is carried on by a symmetrical, the latter, by an unsymmetrical system of
organs: the former produces intermitting, the latter
continuous actions: and, in addition to these, other
differences are pointed out. This distinction of the
two lives, being thus established, each is subdivided
into two orders of Functions. The Animal Functions
are passive, as <i>Sensation</i>: or active, as <i>Locomotion</i> and
<i>Voice</i>; again, the Organic Functions are those of Composition, which are concerned in taking matter into
the system; <i>Digestion</i>, <i>Absorption</i>, <i>Respiration</i>, <i>Circulation</i>, <i>Assimilation</i>; and those of Decomposition, which
reject the materials when they have discharged their
office in the system; and these are again, <i>Absorption</i>,
<i>Circulation</i>, and <i>Secretion</i>. To these are added <i>Calorification</i>, or the production of animal heat. It appears, from what has been said, that <i>Absorption</i> and
<i>Circulation</i> (and we may add <i>Assimilation</i> and <i>Secretion</i>, which are difficult to separate,) belong alike to
the processes of composition and decomposition; nor in
truth, can we, with any rigour, separate the centripetal and centrifugal movements in that vortex which,
as we shall see, is an apt image of organic life.</p>
<p>Several objections have been made to this classification: and in particular, to the terms thus employed.
It has been asserted to be a perversion of language to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page202">202</a></span> ascribe to animals <i>two lives</i>, and to call the higher
faculties in man, perception and volition, the <i>animal</i>
functions. But, as we have already said, when a classification is really good, such objections, which bear
only upon the mode in which it is presented, are by
no means fatal: and it is generally acknowledged by
all the most philosophical cultivators of biology, that
this arrangement of the functions is better suited to
the purposes of the science than those which preceded it.</p>
<p id="b9c3s11">11. But according to the principles which we have
already laid down, the solidity of such a classification
is to be verified by its serving as a useful guide in biological researches. If the arrangement which we have
explained be really founded in natural relations, it will
be found that in proportion as physiologists have
studied the separate functions above enumerated, their
ideas of these functions, and of the powers by which
they are carried on, have become more and more clear;&#8212;have tended more and more to the character of exact
and rigorous science.</p>
<p>To examine how far this has been the case with
regard to all the separate functions, would be to attempt to estimate the value of all the principal physiological speculations of modern times; a task far too
vast and too arduous for any one to undertake who has
not devoted his life to such studies. But it may properly come within the compass of our present plan to
show how, with regard to the broader lines of the
above classification, there has been such a progress as
we have above described, from more loose and inaccurate notions of some of the vital functions to more definite and precise ideas. This I shall attempt to point
out in one or two instances.</p>

is to be observed that at present I do not
speak of the progress of our knowledge with
regard to the detail of the processes which take place
in the human body, but of the approach made to some
distinct Idea of the specially vital part of each process.
In the History of Physiology, it has been seen<a id="fnanchor72-9" href="#note72-9"><span class="fnanchor">72</span></a> that
all the great discoveries made respecting the organs
and motions of the animal frame have been followed
by speculations and hypotheses connected with such
discoveries. The discovery of the circulation of the
blood led to theories of animal heat; the discovery of
the motion of the chyle led to theories of digestion;
the close examination of the process of reproduction in
plants and animals led to theories of generation. In
all these cases, the discovery brought to light some
portion of the process which was mechanical or chemical, but it also, in each instance, served to show that
the process was something more than mechanical or
chemical. The theory attempted to explain the process by the application of known causes; but there
always remained some part of it which must unavoidably be referred to an unknown cause. But though
unknown, such a cause was not a hopeless object of
study. As the vital functions became better and better
understood, it was seen more and more clearly at what
precise points of the process it was necessary to assume
a peculiar vital energy, and what sort of properties <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page204">204</a></span> this energy must be conceived to possess. It was perceived where, in what manner, in what degree, mechanical and chemical agencies were modified, over-ruled,
or counteracted, by agencies which must be hypermechanical and hyperchemical. And thus the discoveries made in anatomy by a laborious examination of
facts, pointed out the necessity of introducing new
ideas, in order that the facts might be intelligible.
Observation taught much; and among other things,
she taught that there was something which could not
be observed, but which must, if possible, be conceived. I shall notice a few instances of this.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.&#8212;<i>Attempts to form a distinct Conception of
Assimilation and Secretion.</i></h4>
<p id="b9c4s2">2. <i>The Ancients.</i>&#8212;That plants and animals grow
by taking into their substance matter previously extraneous, is obvious to all: but as soon as we attempt to
conceive this process distinctly in detail, we find that
it involves no inconsiderable mystery. How does the
same food become blood and flesh, bone and hair?
Perhaps the earliest attempt to explain this mystery,
is that recorded by Lucretius<a id="fnanchor73-9" href="#note73-9"><span class="fnanchor">73</span></a> as the opinion of
Anaxagoras, that food contains some bony, some fleshy
particles, some of blood, and so on. We might, on
this supposition, conceive that the mechanism of the
body appropriates each kind of particle to its suitable
place.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note73-9" href="#fnanchor73-9">73</a></span> Lucr. i. 855. Nunc et Anaxagoræ scrutemur ὁμοιομέρειαν.</div>
<p>But it is easy to refute this essay at philosophizing
(as Lucretius refutes it) by remarking that we do not
find milk in grass, or blood in fruit, though such food
gives such products in cattle and in men. In opposition to this ‘Homoiomereia,’ the opinion that is forced
upon us by the facts is, that the process of nutrition is
not a selection merely, but an <em>assimilation</em>; the organized system does not <em>find</em>, but <em>make</em>, the additions to its
structure. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page205">205</a></span></p>
<p id="b9c4s3">3. <i>Buffon.</i>&#8212;This notion of <i>assimilation</i> may be
variously expressed and illustrated; and all that we
can do here, in order to show the progress of thought,
is to adduce the speculations of those writers who have
been most successful in seizing and marking its peculiar character. Buffon may be taken as an example of
the philosophy of his time on this subject. ‘The body
of the animal,’ says he<a id="fnanchor74-9" href="#note74-9"><span class="fnanchor">74</span></a>, ‘is a kind of <em>interior mould</em>,
in which the matter subservient to its increase is
modelled and assimilated to the whole, in such a way
that, without occasioning any change in the order and
proportion of the parts, there results an augmentation
in each part taken separately. This increase, this development, if we would have a <i>clear idea</i> of it, how
can we obtain it, except by considering the body of
the animal, and each of the parts which is to be
developed, as so many interior moulds which only
receive the accessory matter in the order which results
from the position of all their parts? This development cannot take place, as persons sometimes persuade
themselves, by an addition to the outside; on the contrary, it goes on by an intimate susception which
penetrates the mass; for, in the part thus developed,
the size increases in all parts proportionally, so that
the new matter must penetrate it in all its dimensions: and it is quite necessary that this penetration
of substance must take place in a certain order, and
according to a certain measure; for if this were not
so, some parts would develope themselves more than
others. Now what can there be which shall prescribe
such a rule to the accessory matter except the <i>interior
mould</i>?’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note74-9" href="#fnanchor74-9">74</a></span> <i>Hist. Nat.</i> b. i. c. iii.</div>
<p>To speak of a <i>mould</i> simply, would convey a coarse
mechanical notion, which could not be received as any
useful contribution to physiological speculation. But
this <i>interior</i> mould is, of course, to be understood
figuratively, not as an assemblage of cavities, but as a
collection of laws, shaping, directing, and modifying
the new matter; giving it not only form, but motion <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page206">206</a></span> and activity, such as belong to the parts of an organic
being.</p>
<p id="b9c4s4">4. It must be allowed, however, that even with
this explanation, the comparison is very loose and insufficient. A <i>mould</i> may be permitted to mean a
collection of laws, but still it can convey no conception except that of laws regulated by relations of
space; and such a conception is very plainly quite inadequate to the purpose. What can we conceive of
the interior mould by which chyle is separated from
the aliments at the pores of the lacteals, or tears
secreted in the lacrymatory gland?</p>
<p>An additional objection to this mode of expression of
Buffon is, that it suggests to us only a single marked
change in the assimilated matter, not a continuous
series of changes. Yet the animal fluids and other
substances are, in fact, undergoing a constant series of
changes. Food becomes chyme, and chyme becomes
chyle; chyle is poured into the blood; from the blood
secretions take place, as the bile; the bile is poured
into the digestive canal, and a portion of the matter
previously introduced is rejected out of the system.
Here we must have a series of ‘interior moulds;’ and
these must impress matter at its ejection from the
organic system as well as at its reception. But, moreover, it is probable that none of the above transformations are quite abrupt. Change is going on between the beginning and the end of each stage of the
nutritive circulation. To express the laws of this continuous change, the image of an interior mould is quite
unsuited. We must seek a better mode of conception.</p>
<p id="b9c4s5">5. Vegetable and animal nutrition is, as we have
said, a constant circulation. The matter so assumed is
not all retained: a perpetual subtraction accompanies a
perpetual addition. There is an excretion as well as an
intussusception. The matter which is assumed by the
living creature is retained only for a while, and is then
parted with. The individual is the same, but its parts
are in a perpetual flux: they come and go. For a time
the matter which belongs to the organic body is bound
to it by certain laws: but before it is thus bound, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page207">207</a></span> after it is loose, this matter may circulate about the
universe in any other form. Life consists in a permanent influence over a perpetually changing set of
particles.</p>
<p><i>Cuvier.</i>&#8212;This condition also has been happily expressed, by means of a comparison, by another great
naturalist. ‘If,’ says Cuvier<a id="fnanchor75-9" href="#note75-9"><span class="fnanchor">75</span></a>, ‘if, in order to obtain a
just idea of the essence of life, we consider it in the
beings where its effects are most simple, we shall soon
perceive that it consists in the faculty which belongs to
certain bodily combinations to continue during a determinate time under a determinate form; constantly attracting into their composition a part of the surrounding substances, and giving up in return some part of
their own substance.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note75-9" href="#fnanchor75-9">75</a></span> <i>Règne Animal</i>, i. 11.</div>
<p>‘Life is thus a <em>vortex</em>, more or less rapid, more or
less complex, which has a constant direction, and which
always carries along its stream particles of the same
kinds; but in which the individual particles are constantly entering in and departing out; so that the
<em>form</em> of the living body is more essential to it than its
matter.</p>
<p>‘So long as this motion subsists, the body in which
it takes place is <i>alive</i>; it <i>lives</i>. When the motion stops
finally, the body <i>dies</i>. After death, the elements which
compose the body, given up to the ordinary chemical
affinities, soon separate, and the body which was alive
is dissolved.’</p>
<p>This notion of a vortex<a id="fnanchor76-9" href="#note76-9"><span class="fnanchor">76</span></a> which is permanent while
the matter which composes it constantly changes,&#8212;of
peculiar forces which act in this vortex so long as it
exists, and which give place to chemical forces when <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page208">208</a></span> the circulatory motion ceases,&#8212;appears to express
some of the leading conditions of the assimilative power
of living things in a simple and general manner, and
thus tends to give distinctness to the notion of this
vital function.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note76-9" href="#fnanchor76-9">76</a></span> The definition of life given by
M. de Blainville appears to me not
to differ essentially from that of
Cuvier: ‘Un corps vivant est une
sorte de foyer chimique où il-y-a à
tous momens apport de nouvelles
molecules et départ de molecules anciennes; où la composition n’est
jamais fixe (si ce n’est d’un certain
nombre de parties veritablement
mortes ou en depôt), mais toujours
pour ainsi dire <i>in nisu</i>, d’où mouvement plus ou moins lent et quelquefois chaleur.’&#8212;<i>Principes d’Anat.</i> 1822,
t. i. p. 16.</div>
<p id="b9c4s6">6. But we may observe that this notion of a Vortex
is still insufficient. Particles are not only taken into
the system and circulated through it for a time, but,
as we have seen, they are altered in character in a
manner to us unintelligible, both at their first admission into the system and at every period of their
progress through it. In the vortex each particle is
constantly <em>transformed</em> while it whirls.</p>
<p>It may be said, perhaps, that this transformation of
the kinds of matter may be conceived to be merely a
new arrangement of their particles, and that thus all
the changes which take place in the circulating substances are merely so many additional windings in the
course of the whirling current. But to say this, is to
take for granted the atomic hypothesis in its rudest
form. What right have we to assume that blood and
tears, bile and milk, consist of like particles of matter
differently arranged? What can arrangement, a mere
relation of space, do towards explaining such differences? Is not the insufficiency, the absurdity of such
an assumption proved by the whole course of science?
Are not even chemical changes, according to the best
views hitherto obtained, something more than a mere
new arrangement of particles? And are not vital as
much beyond chemical, as chemical are beyond geometrical modifications? It is not enough, then, to conceive life as a vortex. The particles which are taken
into the organic frame do more than circulate there.
They are, at every point of their circulation, acted
upon by laws of an unknown kind, changing the nature
of the substance which they compose. Life is a vortex
in which vital forces act at every point of the stream:
it is not only a current of whirling <em>matter</em>, but a cycle
of recurring <em>powers</em>.</p>
<p id="b9c4s7">7. <i>Matter and Form.</i>&#8212;This image of a vortex is
closely connected with the representation of life offered <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page209">209</a></span> us by writers of a very different school. In Schelling’s
<i>Lectures on Academic Study</i>, he takes a survey of the
various branches of human knowledge, determining according to his own principles the shape which each
science must necessarily assume. The peculiar character of organization, according to him<a id="fnanchor77-9" href="#note77-9"><span class="fnanchor">77</span></a>, is that the
matter is only an accident of the thing itself, and the
organization consists in Form alone. But this Form,
by its very opposition to Matter, ceases to be independent of it, and is only ideally separable. In organization, therefore, substance and accident, matter
and form, are completely identical<a id="fnanchor78-9" href="#note78-9"><span class="fnanchor">78</span></a>. This notion, that
in organization the Form is essential and the Matter
accidental, or, in other words, that the Form is permanent and the Matter fluctuating and transitory, agrees,
if taken in the grossest sense of matter and form, with
Cuvier’s image of a Vortex. In a whirlpool, or in a
waterfall, the form remains, the matter constantly
passes away and is renewed. But we have already
seen<a id="fnanchor79-9" href="#note79-9"><span class="fnanchor">79</span></a> that in metaphysical speculations in which matter
and form are opposed, the word form is used in a far
more extensive sense than that which denotes a relation of space. It may indeed designate any change
which matter can undergo; and we may very allowably say that food and blood are the same matter under
different <em>forms</em>. Hence if we assert that <em>Life is a constant Form of a circulating Matter</em>, we express Cuvier’s
notion in a mode free from the false suggestion which
‘Vortex’ conveys.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note77-9" href="#fnanchor77-9">77</a></span> Lect. xiii. p. 288.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note78-9" href="#fnanchor78-9">78</a></span> I have not translated Schelling’s words, but given their import as far
as I could.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note79-9" href="#fnanchor79-9">79</a></span> <a href="#b1c1s8">Book i.</a></div>
<p id="b9c4s8">8. We may, however, still add something to this
account of life. The circulating parts of the system
not only circulate, but they form the non-circulating
parts. Or rather, there are no non-circulating parts:
all portions of the frame circulate more or less rapidly.
The food which we take circulates rapidly in the fluids,
more slowly in the flesh, still more slowly in the bones;
but in all these parts it is taken into the system, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page210">210</a></span> retained there for some time, and finally replaced by
other matter. But while it remains in the body, it
exercises upon the other circulating parts the powers
by which their motion is produced. Nutriment forms
and supports the organs, and the organs carry fresh
nutriment to its destination. The peculiar forces of
the living body, and its peculiar structure, are thus
connected in an indescribable manner. The forces
produce the structure; the structure, again, is requisite
for the exertion of the forces. The Idea of an Organic
or Living Being includes this peculiar condition&#8212;that
its construction and powers are such, that it constantly
appropriates to itself new portions of substance which,
so appropriated, become indistinguishable parts of the
whole, and serve to carry on subsequently the same
functions by which they were assimilated. And thus
<em>Organic Life is a constant Form of a circulating Matter, in which the Matter and the Form determine each
other by peculiar laws</em> (<em>that is, by Vital Forces</em>).</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> III.&#8212;<i>Attempts to conceive the forces of Assimilation and Secretion.</i></h4>
<p id="b9c4s9">9. I have already stated that in our attempts to
obtain clear and scientific Ideas of Vital Forces, we
have, in the first place, to seek to understand the
course of change and motion in each function, so as
to see at what points of the process peculiar causes
come into play; and next, to endeavour to obtain some
insight into the peculiar character and attributes of
these causes. Having spoken of the first part of this
mode of investigation in regard to the general nutrition of organic bodies, I must now say a few words on
the second part.</p>
<p>The Forces here spoken of are <em>Vital</em> Forces. From
what has been said, we may see in some measure the
distinction between forces of this kind and mechanical
or chemical forces; the latter tend constantly to produce a final condition, after which there is no further
cause of change: mechanical forces tend to produce
equilibrium; chemical forces tend to produce <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page211">211</a></span> composition or decomposition; and this point once reached,
the matter in which these forces reside is altogether
inert. But an organic body tends to a constant motion, and the highest activity of organic forces shows
itself in continuous change. Again, in mechanical and
chemical forces, the force of any aggregate is the sum
of the forces of all the parts: the sum of the forces
corresponds to the sum of the matter. But in organic
bodies, the amount of effect does not depend on the
matter, but on the form: the particles lose their separate energy, in order to share in that of the system;
they are not added, they are <em>assimilated</em>.</p>
<p id="b9c4s10">10. It is difficult to say whether anything has been
gained to science by the various attempts to assign a
fixed <i>name</i> to the vital force which is thus the immediate cause of Assimilation. It has been called <i>Organic
Attraction</i> or <i>Vital Attraction</i>, <i>Organic Affinity</i> or
<i>Vital Affinity</i>, being thus compared with mechanical
Attraction or chemical Affinity. But, perhaps, as the
process is certainly neither mechanical nor chemical, it
is desirable to appropriate to it a peculiar name; and
the name <i>Assimilation</i>, or <i>Organic Assimilation</i>, by the
usage of good biological writers, is generally employed
for this purpose, and may be taken as the standard
name of this Vital Force. To illustrate this, I will
quote a passage from the excellent <i>Elements of Physiology</i> of Professor Müller. ‘In the process of nutrition
is exemplified the fundamental principle of <i>organic
assimilation</i>. Each elementary particle of an organ
attracts similar particles from the blood, and by the
changes it produces in them, causes them to participate
in the vital principle of the organ itself. Nerves take
up nervous substance, muscles, muscular substance:
even morbid structures have the assimilating power;
warts in the skin grow with their own peculiar structure; in an ulcer, the base and border are nourished in
a way conformable to the mode of action and secretion
determined by the disease.’</p>
<p id="b9c4s11">11. The Force of Organic Assimilation spoken of
in the last paragraph denotes peculiarly the force by
which each organ appropriates to itself a part of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page212">212</a></span> nutriment received into the system, and thus is maintained and augmented with the growth of the whole.
But the growth of the solid parts is only one portion of
the function of nutrition; besides this, we must consider the motion and changes of the fluids, and must
ask what kind of forces may be conceived to produce
these. What are the powers by which chyle is <em>absorbed</em> from the food, by which bile is <em>secreted</em> from
the blood, by which the circulating <em>motion</em> of these and
all other fluids of the body are constantly maintained?
To the questions,&#8212;What are the forces by which <i>absorption</i>, <i>secretion</i>, and the <i>vital motions</i>, of fluids are
produced?&#8212;no satisfactory answer has been returned.
Yet still some steps have been made, which it may
be instructive to point out.</p>
<p id="b9c4s12">12. In <i>Absorption</i> it would appear that a part of the
agency is inorganic; for not only dead membranes, but
inorganic substances, absorb fluids, and even absorb
them with elective forces, according to the ingredients,
of the fluid. A force which is of this kind, and which
has been termed <i>Endosmose</i>, has been found to produce very curious effects. When a membrane separates two fluids, holding in solution different ingredients, the fluids pass through the membrane in an
imperceptible manner, and mix or exchange their elements. The force which produces these effects is
capable of balancing a very considerable pressure. It
appears, moreover, to depend, at least among other
causes, upon attractions operating between the elements of the solids and the fluids, as well as between
the different fluids; and this force, though thus apparently of a mechanical and chemical nature, probably
has considerable influence in vital phenomena.</p>
<p id="b9c4s13">13. But still, though Endosmose may account in
part for absorption in some cases, it is certain that
there is some other vital force at work in this process.
There must be, as Müller says<a id="fnanchor80-9" href="#note80-9"><span class="fnanchor">80</span></a>, ‘an organic attraction
of a kind hitherto unknown.’ ‘If absorption,’ he
adds<a id="fnanchor81-9" href="#note81-9"><span class="fnanchor">81</span></a>, is to be explained in a manner analogous to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page213">213</a></span> the laws of endosmose, it must be supposed that a chemical affinity, resulting from the vital process itself,
is exerted between the chyme in the intestines and
the chyle in the lacteals, by which the chyle is enabled to attract the chyme without being itself attracted
by it. But such affinity or attraction would be of a
vital nature, since it does not exist after death.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note80-9" href="#fnanchor80-9">80</a></span> <i>Physiology</i>, p. 299.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note81-9" href="#fnanchor81-9">81</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 301.</div>
<p id="b9c4s14">14. If the force of absorption be thus mysterious in
its nature, the force of <i>Secretion</i> is still more so. In
this case we have an organ filled with a fine net-work
of blood-vessels, and in the cavities of some <i>gland</i>, or
open part, we have a new fluid formed, of a kind altogether different from the blood itself. It is easily
shown that this cannot be explained by any action of
pores or capillary tubes. But what conception can we
form of the forces by which such a change is produced?
Here, again, I shall borrow the expressions of Müller,
as presenting the last result of modern physiology. He
says<a id="fnanchor82-9" href="#note82-9"><span class="fnanchor">82</span></a>, ‘The more probable supposition is, that by
virtue of imbibition, or the general organic porosity,
the fluid portion of the blood becomes diffused through
the tissue of the secreting organ; that the external
surface of the glandular canals exerts a chemical attraction on the elements of the fluid, infusing into
them at the same time a tendency to unite in new
combinations; and then repels them in a manner which
is certainly quite inexplicable, towards the inner surface of the secreting membrane, or glandular canals.’ ‘Although quite unsupported by facts,’ he adds, ‘this
theory of attraction and repulsion is not without its
analogy in physical phenomena; and it would appear
that very similar powers effect the elimination of the
fluid in secretion, and cause it to be taken up by
the lymphatics in absorption.’ He elsewhere says<a id="fnanchor83-9" href="#note83-9"><span class="fnanchor">83</span></a>,
‘Absorption seems to depend on an attraction the
nature of which is unknown, but of which the very
counterpart, as it were, takes place in secretion; the
fluids altered by the secreting action being repelled
towards the free side or open surface only of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page214">214</a></span> secreting membranes, and then pressed forwards by the
successive portions of the fluids secreted.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note82-9" href="#fnanchor82-9">82</a></span> <i>Physiology</i>, p. 464.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note83-9" href="#fnanchor83-9">83</a></span>  <i>Ib.</i> p. 301.</div>
<p id="b9c4s15">15. With regard to the forces which produce the
<i>Motion</i> of absorbed or secreted fluids along their destined course, it may be seen, from the last quoted
sentence, that the same vital force which changes the
nature, also produces the movement of the substance.
The fluids are pressed forwards by the successive portions absorbed or secreted. That this is the sole cause,
or at least a very powerful cause, of the motion of
the nutritive fluids in organic bodies, is easily shown
by experience. It is found<a id="fnanchor84-9" href="#note84-9"><span class="fnanchor">84</span></a> that the organs which
effect the ascent of the sap in trees during the spring
are the terminal parts of the roots; that the whole
force by which the sap is impelled upwards is the
<i>vis a tergo</i>, as it has been called, the force pushing
from behind, exerted in the roots. And thus the force
which produces this motion is exerted exactly at those
points where the organic body selects from the contiguous mass those particles which it absorbs and
appropriates. And the same may most probably be
taken for the cause of the motion of the lymph and
chyle; at least, Müller says<a id="fnanchor85-9" href="#note85-9"><span class="fnanchor">85</span></a> that no other motive
power has been detected which impels those fluids
in their course.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note84-9" href="#fnanchor84-9">84</a></span> Müller, p. 300.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note85-9" href="#fnanchor85-9">85</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> p. 254.</div>
<p>Thus, though we must confess the Vital Force concerned in Assimilation and Secretion to be unknown
in its nature, we still obtain a view of some of the attributes which it involves. It has mechanical efficacy,
producing motions, often such as would require great
mechanical force. But it exerts at the same point
both an attraction and a repulsion, attracting matter
on one side, and repelling it on the other; and in
this circumstance it differs entirely from mechanical
forces. Again, it is not only mechanical but chemical, producing a complete change in the nature of the
substance on which it acts; to which we must add
that the changes produced by the vital forces are
such as, for the most part, our artificial chemistry <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page215">215</a></span> cannot imitate. But, again, by the action of the vital
force at any point of an organ, not only are fluids
made to pass, and changed as they pass, but the organ
itself is maintained and strengthened, so as to continue
or to increase its operation: and thus the vital energy
supports its activity by its action, and is augmented
by being exerted.</p>
<p>We have thus endeavoured to obtain a view of some
of the peculiar characters which belong to the Force of
Organic Assimilation;&#8212;the Force by which life is kept
up, conceived in the most elementary form to which we
can reduce it by observation and contemplation. It appears that it is a force which not only produces motion
and chemical change, but also <i>vitalizes</i> the matter on
which it acts, giving to it the power of producing like
changes on other matter, and so on indefinitely. It
not only circulates the particles of matter, but puts
them in a stream of which the flow is development as
well as movement.</p>
<p>The force of Organic Assimilation being thus conceived, it becomes instructive to compare it with the
force concerned in Generation, which we shall therefore
endeavour to do.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">Sect.</span> IV.&#8212;<i>Attempts to conceive the Process of Generation.</i></h4>
<p id="b9c4s16">16. At first sight the function of Nutrition appears
very different from the function of Generation. In
the former case we have merely the existing organs
maintained or enlarged, and their action continued; in
the latter, we have a new individual produced and extricated from the parent. The term <i>Reproduction</i> has,
no doubt, been applied, by different writers, to both
these functions;&#8212;to the processes by which an organ
when mutilated, is restored by the forces of the living
body, and to the process by which a new generation of
individuals is produced which may be considered as
taking the place of the old generation, as these are
gradually removed by death. But these are obviously
different senses of the word. In the latter case, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page216">216</a></span> term <i>Reproduction</i> is figuratively used; for the <em>same</em>
individuals are not reproduced; but the species is kept
up by the propagation of new individuals, as in nutrition the organ is kept up by the assimilation of new
matter. To escape ambiguity, I shall avoid using the
term <i>Reproduction</i> in the sense of <i>Propagation</i>.</p>
<p id="b9c4s17">17. In Nutrition, as we have seen, the matter,
which from being at first extraneous, is appropriated
by the living system, and directed to the sustentation
of the organs, undergoes a series of changes of which
the detail eludes our observation and apprehension.
The nutriment which we receive contributes to the
growth of flesh and bone, viscera and organs of sense.
But we cannot trace in its gradual changes a visible
preparation for its final office. The portion of matter
which is destined to repair the waste of the eye or the
skin, is not found assuming a likeness to the parts of
the eye or the structure of the skin, as it comes near
the place where it is moulded into its ultimate form.
The new parts are insinuated among the old ones, in
an obscure and imperceptible matter. We can trace
their progress only by their effects. The organs <em>are</em>
nourished, and that is almost all we can learn: we
cannot discover <em>how</em> this is done. We cannot follow
nature through a series of manifest preparations and
processes to this result.</p>
<p id="b9c4s18">18. In Generation the case is quite different. The
young being is formed gradually and by a series of
distinguishable processes. It is included within the
parent before it is extruded, and approaches more or
less to the likeness of the parent before it is detached.
While it is still an embryo, it shares in the nutriment
which circulates through the system of the mother;
but its destination is already clear. While the new
and the old parts, in every other portion of the mother,
are undistinguishably mixed together, this new part,
the fœtus, is clearly distinct from the rest of the system,
and becomes rapidly more and more so, as the time
goes on. And thus there is formed, not a new part,
but a new whole; it is not an organ which is kept up,
but an offspring which is prepared. The progeny is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page217">217</a></span> included in the parent, and is gradually fitted to be
separated from it. The young is at first only the
development of a part of the organization of the
mother;&#8212;of a germ, an ovule. But it is not developed like other organs, retaining its general form. It
does not become merely a larger bud, a larger ovule;
it is entirely changed; it becomes&#8212;from a bud&#8212;a
blossom, a flower, a fruit, a seed; from an ovule it becomes an egg, a chick, a bird; or it may be, a fœtus, a
child. The original rudiment is not merely nourished,
but unfolded and transformed through the most marked
and remote changes, gradually tending to the form of
the new individual.</p>
<p id="b9c4s19">19. But this is not all. The fœtus is, as we have
said, a development of a portion of the mother’s organization. But the fœtus (supposing it female) is a
likeness of the mother. The mother, even before conception, contains within herself the germs of her progeny; the female fœtus, therefore, at a certain stage of
development, will contain also the germs of possible
progeny; and thus we may have the germs of future
generations, pre-existing and included successively
within one another. And this state of things, which
thus suggests itself to us as possible, is found to be
the case in facts which observation supplies. Anatomists have traced ovules in the unborn fœtus, and
thus we have three generations included one within
another.</p>
<p id="b9c4s20">20. Supposing we were to stop here, the process of
propagation might appear to be altogether different
from that of nutrition. The latter, as we have seen,
may be in some measure illustrated by the image of a
<i>vortex</i>; the former has been represented by the image
of a series of germs, <i>sheathed</i> one within another successively, and this without any limit. This view of
the subject has been termed the doctrine of the <i>Pre-existence of germs</i>; and has been designated by German writers by a term ‘Einschachtelungs-theorie’
descriptive of the successive sheathing of which I have
spoken. Imitating this term, we may call it <i>the Theory
of successive inclusion</i>. It has always had many <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page218">218</a></span> adherents; and has been, perhaps, up to the present
time, the most current opinion on the subject of generation. Cuvier inclines to this opinion<a id="fnanchor86-9" href="#note86-9"><span class="fnanchor">86</span></a>. ‘Fixed forms
perpetuating themselves by generation distinguish the
species of living things. These forms do not produce
themselves, do not change themselves. Life supposes
them to exist already; its flame can be lighted only in
organization previously prepared; and the most profound meditations and the most delicate researches
terminate alike in the mystery of the <i>pre-existence
of germs</i>.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note86-9" href="#fnanchor86-9">86</a></span> <i>Règne Animal</i>, p. 20.</div>
<p id="b9c4s21">21. Yet this doctrine is full of difficulty. It is, as
Cuvier says, a mysterious view of the subject;&#8212;so
mysterious, that it can hardly be accepted by us, who
seek distinct conceptions as the basis of our philosophy.
Can it be true, not only that the germ of the offspring
is originally included in the parent, but also the germs
of <em>its</em> progeny, and so on without limit:&#8212;so that
each fruitful individual contains in itself an infinite
collection of future possible individuals;&#8212;a reserve
of infinite succeeding generations? This is hard to
admit. Have we no alternative? What is the opposite doctrine?</p>
<p id="b9c4s22">22. The opposite doctrine deserves at least some
notice. It extends, to the production of a new individual, the conception of growth by nutrition. According to this view, we suppose propagation to take place,
not as in the view just spoken of, by inclusion and extrusion, but by assimilation and development;&#8212;not by
the material pre-existence of germs, but by the communication of vital forces to new matter. This opinion
appears to be entertained by some of the most eminent
physiologists of the present time. Thus, Müller says,
‘The organic force is also creative. The organic force
which resides in the whole, and on which the existence
of each part depends, has also the property of generating, from organic matter, the parts necessary to the
whole.’ Life, he adds, is not merely a harmony of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page219">219</a></span> parts. On the contrary, the harmonious action of the
parts subsists only by the influence of a force pervading
all parts of the body. ‘This force exists before the
harmonizing parts, which are in fact formed by it
during the development of the embryo.’ And again;
‘The creative force exists in the germ, and creates in
it the essential force of the future animal. The germ
is <em>potentially</em> the whole animal: during the development of the germ the parts which constitute the actual
whole are produced.’</p>
<p id="b9c4s23">23. In this view, we extend to the reproduction of
an individual the same conception of organic assimilation which we have already arrived at, as the best
notion we can form of the force by which the reproduction and sustentation of parts takes place. And is
not such an extension really very consistent? If a
living thing can appropriate to itself extraneous matter, invest it with its own functions, and thus put it in
the stream of constant development, may we not conceive the development of a new <em>whole</em> to take place in
this way as well as of a <em>part</em>? If the organized being
can infuse into new matter its vital forces, is there any
contradiction in supposing this infusion to take place
in the full measure which is requisite for the production of a new individual? The force of organic assimilation is transferred to the very matter on which it
acts; it may be transferred so that the operation of
the forces produces not only an organ, but a system of
organs.</p>
<p id="b9c4s24">24. This identification of the forces which operate
in Nutrition and Generation may at first seem forced
and obscure, in consequence of the very strong apparent differences of the two processes which we have
already noticed. But this defect in the doctrine is
remedied by the consideration of what may be considered as intermediate cases. It is not true that, in
the nutrition of special organs, the matter is always
conveyed to its ultimate destination without being on
its way moulded into the form which it is finally to
bear, as the embryo is moulded into the form of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page220">220</a></span> future individual. On the contrary, there are cases in
which the waste of the organs is supplied by the
growth of new ones, which are prepared and formed
before they are used, just as the offspring is prepared
and formed before it is separated from the parent.
This is the case with the teeth of many animals, and
especially with the teeth of animals of the crocodile
kind. Young teeth grow near the root of the old
ones, like buds on the stem of a plant; and as these
become fully developed, they take the place of the
parent tooth when that dies and is cast away. And
these new teeth in their turn are succeeded by others
which germinate from them. Several generations of
such teeth, it is said as many as four, have been detected by anatomists, visibly existing at the same time;
just as several generations of germs of individuals
have been, as we already stated, observed included in
one another. But this case of the teeth appears to
show very strikingly how insufficient such observations are to establish the doctrine of successive inclusion, or of the pre-existence of germs. Are we to
suppose that every crocodile’s tooth includes in itself
the germs of an infinite number of possible teeth, as
in the theory of pre-existing germs every individual
includes an infinite number of individuals? If this be
true of teeth, we must suppose that organ to follow laws entirely different from almost every other organ;
for no one would apply to the other organs in general
such a theory of reproduction. But if such a theory
be not maintained respecting the teeth, how can we
maintain the theory of the pre-existing germs of individuals, which has no recommendation except that
of accounting for exactly the same phenomena?</p>
<p>It would seem, then, that we are, by the closest consideration of the subject, led to conceive the forces by
which generation is produced, as forces which vitalize
certain portions of matter, and thus prepare them for
development according to organic forms; and thus the
conception of this Generative Force is identified with
the conception of the Force of Organic Assimilation, to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page221">221</a></span> which we were led by the consideration of the process
of nutrition.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to give further distinctness and
fixity to this conception of one of the vital forces; but
I shall proceed to exemplify the same analysis of life
by some remarks upon another Vital Process, and the
Forces of which it exhibits the operation.</p>

formerly noticed the distinctions of <em>organic</em>
and <em>animal</em> functions, organic and animal
forces, as one of the most marked distinctions to
which physiologists have been led in their analysis of
the vital powers. I have now taken one of the former,
the <i>organic</i> class of functions, namely, Nutrition; and
have endeavoured to point out in some measure the
peculiar nature of the vital forces by which this function is carried on. It may serve to show the extent
and the difficulty of this subject, if, before quitting
it, I offer a few remarks suggested by a function
belonging to the other class, the <i>animal</i> functions.
This I shall briefly do with respect to <i>Voluntary Motion</i>.</p>
<p id="b9c5s2">2. In the History of Physiology, I have already
related the progress of the researches by which the
organs employed in voluntary motion became known
to anatomists. It was ascertained to the satisfaction
of all physiologists, that the immediate agents in such
motion are the muscles; that the muscles are in some
way contracted, when the nerves convey to them the
agency of the will; and that thus the limbs are moved.
It was ascertained, also, that the nerves convey sensations from the organs of sense inwards, so as to make
these sensations the object of the animal’s consciousness. In man and the higher animals, these impressions upon the nerves are all conveyed to one internal
organ, the brain; and from this organ all impressions
of the will appear to proceed; and thus the brain is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page223">223</a></span> the center of animal life, towards which sensations
converge, and from which volitions diverge.</p>
<p>But this being the process, we are led to inquire
how far we can obtain any knowledge, or form any
conception, of the vital forces by means of which the
process is carried on. And here I have further stated
in the History<a id="fnanchor87-9" href="#note87-9"><span class="fnanchor">87</span></a>, that the transfer of sensations and
volitions along the nerves was often represented as
consisting in the motion of a Nervous Fluid. I have
related that the hypothesis of such a fluid, conveying
its impressions either by motions of translation or of
vibration, was countenanced by many great names,
as Newton, Haller, and even Cuvier. But I have
ventured to express my doubt whether this hypothesis
can have much value: ‘for,’ I have said, ‘this principle cannot be mechanical, chemical, or physical, and
therefore cannot be better understood by embodying it
in a fluid. The difficulty we have in conceiving what
the force <em>is</em>, is not got rid of by explaining the machinery by which it is <em>transferred</em>.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note87-9" href="#fnanchor87-9">87</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xvii. c. v. s. 2.</div>
<p id="b9c5s3">3. I may add, that no succeeding biological researches appear to have diminished the force of these
considerations. In modern times, attempts have repeatedly been made to identify the nervous fluid with
electricity or galvanism. But these attempts have not
been satisfactory or conclusive of the truth of such an
identity: and Professor Müller probably speaks the
judgment of the most judicious physiologists, when
he states it as his opinion, after examining the evidence<a id="fnanchor88-9" href="#note88-9"><span class="fnanchor">88</span></a>, ‘That the vital actions of the nerves are not
attended with the development of any galvanic currents which our instruments can detect; and that the
laws of action of the nervous principle are totally different from those of electricity.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note88-9" href="#fnanchor88-9">88</a></span> <i>Elem. Phys.</i> p. 640.</div>
<p>That the powers by which the nerves are the instruments of sensation, and the muscles of motion, are
vital endowments, incapable of being expressed or explained by any comparison with mechanical, chemical,
and electrical forces, is the result which we should <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page224">224</a></span> expect to find, judging from the whole analogy of science; and which thus is confirmed by the history of
physiology up to the present time. We naturally, then,
turn to inquire whether such peculiar vital powers
have been brought into view with any distinctness
and clearness.</p>
<p id="b9c5s4">4. The property by which muscles, under proper
stimulation, contract and produce motion, has been
termed <i>Irritability</i> or <i>Contractility</i>; the property by
which nerves are susceptible of their appropriate impressions has been termed <i>Sensibility</i>. A very few
words on each of these subjects must suffice.</p>
<p><i>Irritability.</i>&#8212;I have, in the History of Physiology<a id="fnanchor89-9" href="#note89-9"><span class="fnanchor">89</span></a>,
noticed that Glisson, a Cambridge professor, distinguished the Irritation of muscles as a peculiar property, different from any merely mechanical or physical action. I have mentioned, also, that he divides
Irritation into <i>natural</i>, <i>vital</i>, and <i>animal</i>; and points
out, though briefly, the graduated differences of Irritability in different organs. Although these opinions
did not at first attract much notice, about seventy
years afterwards attention was powerfully called to
this vital force, <i>Irritability</i>, by Haller. I shall borrow
Sprengel’s reflections on this subject.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note89-9" href="#fnanchor89-9">89</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xvii. c. v.</div>
<p>‘Hitherto men had been led to see more and more
clearly that the cause of the bodily functions, the fundamental power of the animal frame, is not to be
sought in the mechanism, and still less in the mixture of the parts. In this conviction, they had had recourse partly to the quite supersensuous principle of
the Soul, partly to the half-material principle of the
Animal Spirits, in order to explain the bodily motions.
Glisson alone saw the necessity of assuming an Original Power in the fibres, which, independent of the
influence of the animal spirits, should produce contraction in them. And Gorter first held that this Original
Power was not to be confined to the muscles, but to be
extended to all parts of the living body. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page225">225</a></span></p>
<p>‘But as yet the laws of this Power were not known,
nor had men come to an understanding whether it
were fully distinct from the elasticity of the parts,
or by what causes it was put in action. They had
neither instituted observations nor experiments which
established its relation to other assumed forces of the
body. There was still wanting a determination of the
peculiar seat of this power, and experiments to trace
its gradual differences in different parts of the body.
In addition to other causes, the necessity of the assumption of such a power was felt the more, in consequence of the prevalence of Leibnitz’s doctrine of the
activity of matter; but it was an occult quality, and
remained so till Haller, by numerous experiments and
solid observations, placed in a clear light the peculiarities of the powers of the animal body.’</p>
<p id="b9c5s5">5. Perhaps, however, Haller did more in the way
of determining experimentally the limits and details of
the application of this idea of Irritability as a peculiar
attribute, than in developing the Idea itself. In that
way his merits were great. As early as the year 1739,
he published his opinion upon Irritability as the cause
of muscular motion, which he promulgated again in
1743. But from the year 1747 he was more attentive
to the peculiarities of Irritability, and its difference
from the effect of the nerves. In the first edition of
his <i>Physiology</i>, which appeared in 1747, he distinguished three kinds of Force in muscles,&#8212;the Dead
Force, the Innate Force, and the Nervous Power. The
first is identical with the elastic force of dead matter,
and remains even after death. The <i>innate force</i> continues only a short time after death, and discloses
itself especially by alternate oscillations; the motions
which arise from this are much more lively than those
which arise from mere elasticity: they are not excited
by tension, nor by pressure, nor by any mechanical
alteration, but only by <em>irritation</em>. The <i>nervous force</i>
of the muscle is imparted to it from without by the
nerves; it preserves the <i>irritability</i>, which cannot long
subsist without the influence of the nervous force, but
is not identical with it. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page226">226</a></span></p>
<p>In the year 1752, Haller laid before the Society of
Göttingen the result of one hundred and ninety experiments; from which it appears to what parts of the
animal system Irritability and Nervous Power belong.
These I need not enumerate. He also investigated
with care its gradations in those parts which do possess
it. Thus the heart possesses it in the highest degree,
and other organs follow in their order.</p>
<p id="b9c5s6">6. Haller’s doctrine was, that there resides in the
muscles a peculiar vital power by which they contract,
and that this power is distinct from the attributes of
the nerves. And this doctrine has been accepted by
the best physiologists of modern times. But this distinction of the <i>irritability</i> of the muscles from the
<i>sensibility</i> of the nerves became somewhat clearer by
giving to the former attribute the name of <i>Contractility</i>. This accordingly was done; it is, for example,
the phraseology used by Bichat. By speaking of
<i>animal sensibility</i> and <i>animal contractility</i>, the passive
and the active element of the processes of animal life
are clearly separated and opposed to each other. The
sensations which we feel, and the muscular action
which we exert, may be closely and inseparably connected, yet still they are clearly distinguishable. We
can easily in our apprehension separate the titillation
felt in the nose on taking snuff, from the action of the
muscles in sneezing; or the perception of an object
falling towards the eye, from the exertion which shuts
the eye-lid; although in these cases the passive and
active part of the process are almost or quite inseparable in fact. And this clear separation of the
active from the passive power is something, it would
seem, peculiar to the Animal Vital Powers; it is a
character by which they differ, not only from mechanical, chemical, and all other merely physical forces,
but even from Organic Vital Powers.</p>
<p id="b9c5s7">7. But this difference between the Animal and the
Organic Vital Powers requires to be further insisted
upon, for it appears to have been overlooked or denied
by very eminent physiologists. For instance, Bichat
classifies the Vital Powers as Animal Sensibility, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page227">227</a></span> Animal Contractility, Organic Sensibility, Organic Contractility.</p>
<p>Now the view which suggests itself to us, in agreement with what has been said, is this:&#8212;that though
Animal Sensibility and Animal Contractility are
clearly and certainly distinct, Organic Sensibility and
Organic Contractility are neither separable in fact nor
in our conception, but together make up a single Vital
Power. That they are not separable in fact is, indeed,
acknowledged by Bichat himself. ‘The organic contractility,’ he says<a id="fnanchor90-9" href="#note90-9"><span class="fnanchor">90</span></a>, ‘can never be separated from the
sensibility of the same kind; the reaction of the excreting tubes is immediately connected with the action
which the secreted fluids exercise upon them: the
contraction of the heart must necessarily succeed the
influx of the blood into it.’ It is not wonderful, therefore, that it should have happened, as he complains,
that ‘authors have by no means separated these two
things, either in their consideration or in language.’
We cannot avoid asking, Are Organic Sensibility and
Organic Contractility really anything more than two
different aspects of the same thing, like action and reaction in mechanics, which are only two ways of considering the action which takes place at a point; or
like the positive and negative electricities, which, as
we have seen, always co-exist and correspond to each
other?</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note90-9" href="#fnanchor90-9">90</a></span> <i>Life and Death</i>, p. 94.</div>
<p id="b9c5s8">8. But we may observe, moreover, that Bichat, by
his use of the term Contractility, includes in it powers
to which it cannot with any propriety be applied.
Why should we suppose that the vital powers of absorption, secretion, assimilation, are of such a nature
that the name <i>contractility</i> may be employed to describe them? We have seen, in the last chapter, that
the most careful study of these powers leads us to
conceive them in a manner altogether removed from
any notion of contraction. Is it not then an abuse of
language which cannot possibly lead to anything but <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page228">228</a></span> confusion, to write thus<a id="fnanchor91-9" href="#note91-9"><span class="fnanchor">91</span></a>: ‘The insensible organic contractility is that, by virtue of which the excreting
tubes react upon their respective fluids, the secreting
organs upon the blood which flows into them, the parts
where nutrition is performed upon the nutritive juices,
and the lymphatics upon the substances which excite their open extremities’? In the same manner he
ascribes<a id="fnanchor92-9" href="#note92-9"><span class="fnanchor">92</span></a> to the peculiar sensibility of each organ the
peculiarity of its products and operations. An increased absorption is produced by an increased susceptibility of the ‘absorbent orifices.’ And thus, in
this view, each organic power may be contemplated
either as sensibility or as contractility, and may be
supposed to be rendered more intense by magnifying
either of these its aspects; although, in fact, neither
can be conceived to be increased without an exactly
commensurate increase of the other.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note91-9" href="#fnanchor91-9">91</a></span>  <i>Life and Death</i>, p. 95.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note92-9" href="#fnanchor92-9">92</a></span>  <i>Ib.</i> p. 90.</div>
<p id="b9c5s9">9. This opinion, unfounded as it thus appears to
be, that all the different organic vital powers are
merely different kinds of Contractility or Excitability,
was connected with the doctrines of Brown and his
followers, which were so celebrated in the last century,
that all diseases arise from increase or from diminution
of the Vital Force. The considerations which have
already offered themselves would lead us to assent to
the judgment which Cuvier has pronounced upon this
system. ‘The theory of excitation,’ he says, ‘so celebrated in these later times by its influence upon pathology and therapeutick, is at bottom only a modification
of that, in which, including under a common name
Sensibility and Irritability,’ and we may add, applying
this name to all the Vital Powers, ‘the speculator
takes refuge in an abstraction so wide, that if, by
it, he simplifies medicine, he by it annihilates all positive physiology<a id="fnanchor93-9" href="#note93-9"><span class="fnanchor">93</span></a>.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note93-9" href="#fnanchor93-9">93</a></span> <i>Hist. des Sc. Nat. depuis</i> 1789, i. 219.</div>
<p id="b9c5s10">10. The separation of the nervous influence and
the muscular irritability, although it has led to many
highly instructive speculations, is not without its <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page229">229</a></span> difficulties, when viewed with reference to the Idea of
Vital Power. If the irritability of each muscle reside
in the muscle itself, how does it differ from a mere
mechanical force, as elasticity? But, in point of fact,
it is certain that the muscular irritability of the animal body is not an attribute of the muscle itself independent of its connexion with the system. No muscle,
or other part, removed from the body, <em>long</em> preserves
its irritability. This power cannot subsist permanently,
except in connexion with an organic whole. This
condition peculiarly constitutes irritability a <em>living</em>
force: and this condition would be satisfied by considering the force as derived from the nervous system;
but it appears that though the nervous system has the
most important influence upon all vital actions, the
muscular irritability must needs be considered as something distinct. And thus the Irritability or Contractility of the muscle is a peculiar endowment of the
texture, but it is at the same time an endowment
which can only co-exist with life; it is, in short, a
peculiar Vital Power.</p>
<p id="b9c5s11">11. This necessity of the union of the muscle with
the whole nervous system, in order that it may possess
irritability, was the meaning of the true part of Stahl’s
psychical doctrine; and the reason why he and his adherents persisted in asserting the power of the soul
even over involuntary motions. This doctrine was
the source of much controversy in later times.</p>
<p>‘But,’ says Cuvier<a id="fnanchor94-9" href="#note94-9"><span class="fnanchor">94</span></a>, ‘this opposition of opinion may
be reconciled by the intimate union of the nervous
substance with the fibre and the other contractile organic elements, and by their reciprocal action;&#8212;doctrines which had been presented with so much probability by physiologists of the Scotch school, but which
were elevated above the rank of hypotheses only by the
observations of more recent times.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note94-9" href="#fnanchor94-9">94</a></span> <i>Hist. des Sc. Nat. depuis</i> 1789, i. 213.</div>
<p>‘The fibre does not contract by itself, but by the
influence of the nervous filaments, which are always
united with it. The change which produces the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page230">230</a></span> contraction cannot take place without the concurrence of
both these substances; and it is further necessary that
it should be occasioned each time by an exterior cause,
by a stimulant.</p>
<p>‘The Will is one of these stimulants; but it only
excites the Irritability, it does not constitute it; for in
the case of persons paralytic from apoplexy, the Irritability remains, though the power of the Will over it is
gone. Thus <em>irritability</em> depends in part on the <em>nerve</em>,
but not on the <em>sensibility</em>: this last is another property, still more admirable and occult than the irritability; but it is only one among several functions
of the nervous system. It would be an abuse of words
to extend this denomination to functions unaccompanied by perception.’</p>
<p id="b9c5s12">12. Supposing, then, that Contractility is established as a peculiar Vital Power residing in the
muscles, we may ask whether we can trace with any
further exactness the seat and nature of this power.
It would be unsuitable to the nature of the present
work to dwell upon the anatomical discussions bearing upon this point. I will only remark that some
anatomists maintain<a id="fnanchor95-9" href="#note95-9"><span class="fnanchor">95</span></a> that muscles are contracted by
those fibres assuming a zigzag form, which at first were
straight. Others (Professor Owen and Dr. A. Thompson) doubt the accuracy of this observation; and conceive that the muscular fibre becomes shorter and
thicker, but does not deviate from a right line. We
may remark that the latter kind of action appears to
be more elementary in its nature. We can, as a matter
of geometry, conceive a straight line thrown into a
zigzag shape by muscular contractions taking place between remote parts of it; but it is difficult to conceive
by what <em>elementary</em> mode of action a straight fibre could
bend itself at certain points, and at certain points only;
since the elementary force must act at every point of
the fibre, and not at certain selected points.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note95-9" href="#fnanchor95-9">95</a></span> Müller, <i>Elem. Phys.</i> p. 887.</div>
<p id="b9c5s13">13. A circumstance which remarkably marks the
difference between the vital force of Contractility, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page231">231</a></span> inherent in muscles, and any merely dead or mechanical
force, is this; that in assuming their contractile state,
muscles exert a tension which they could not themselves support or convey if not strengthened by their
vital irritability. They are capable of raising weights
by their exertion, which will tear them asunder when
the power of contraction is lost by death. This has
induced Cuvier and other physiologists<a id="fnanchor96-9" href="#note96-9"><span class="fnanchor">96</span></a> to believe
‘that in the moment of action, the particles that compose a fibre, not only approach towards each other
longitudinally, but that their cohesive attraction becomes instantaneously much greater than it was before: for without such an increase of cohesive force,
the tendency to shorten could not, as it would appear,
prevent the fibre from being torn.’ We see here the
difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of conceiving
muscular contractility as a mere mechanical force; and
perhaps there is little hope of any advantage by calling
in the aid of chemical hypothesis to solve the mechanical difficulty. Cuvier conjectures that a sudden
change in the chemical composition may thus so
quickly and powerfully augment the cohesion. But
we may ask, are not a chemical synthesis and analysis, suddenly performed by a mere act of the will, as
difficult to conceive as a sudden increase and decrease
of mechanical power directly produced by the same
cause?</p>

<p id="b9c5s14">14. <i>Sensibility.</i> The nerves are the organs and
channels of Sensibility. By means of them we receive
our sensations, whether of mere pleasure and pain, or
of qualities which we ascribe to external objects, as a
bitter taste, a sweet odour, a shrill sound, a red colour,
a hard or a hot feeling of touch. Some of these sensations are but obscurely the objects of our consciousness; as for example the feeling which our feet have of
the ground, or the sight which our eyes have of neighbouring objects, when we walk in a reverie. In these
cases the sensations, though obscure, exist; for they <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page232">232</a></span> serve to balance and guide us as we walk. In other
cases, our sensations are distinctly and directly the objects of our attention.</p>
<p>But our Sensations, as we have already said, we
ascribe as Qualities to external objects. By our senses
we perceive objects, and thus our <i>sensations</i> become
<i>perceptions</i>. We have not only the sensation of <i>round</i>,
<i>purple</i>, and <i>green</i>, repeated and varied, but the perception of a <i>bunch of grapes</i> partly ripe and partly unripe.
We have not only sensations of noise and of variously-coloured specks rapidly changing their places, but we
have perceptions, by sound and sight, of a stone rolling down the hill and crushing the shrubs in its path.
We scarcely ever dwell upon our Sensations; our
thoughts are employed upon Objects. We regard the
impressions upon our nerves, not for what they <em>are</em>,
but for what they <em>tell</em> us.</p>
<p>But in what Language do the impressions upon the
nerves thus speak to us of an external world,&#8212;of the
forms and qualities and actions of objects? How is it
that by the aid of our nervous system we become acquainted not only with impressions but with <em>things</em>;
that we learn not only the relation of objects to us,
but to one another?</p>
<p id="b9c5s15">15. It has been shown at some length in the previous Books, that the mode in which Sensations are
connected in our minds so as to convey to us the
knowledge of Objects and their Relations, is by being
contemplated with reference to <em>Ideas</em>. Our Sensations,
connected by the Idea of Space, become Figures; connected by the Idea of Time, they become Causes and
Effects; connected by the Idea of Resemblance, they
become Individuals and Kinds; connected by the Idea
of Organization, they become Living Things. It has
been shown that without these Ideas there can be
no connexion among our sensations, and therefore no
perception of Figure, Action, Kind, or in short, of
bodies under any aspect whatever. Sensations are the
rude <em>Matter</em> of our perceptions; and are nothing, except so far as they have <em>Form</em> given them by Ideas. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page233">233</a></span> But thus moulded by our Ideas, Sensation becomes
the source of an endless store of important Knowledge
of every possible kind.</p>
<p id="b9c5s16">16. But one of the most obvious uses of our perceptions and our knowledge is to direct our Actions.
It is suitable to the condition of our being that when
we perceive a bunch of grapes, we should be able
to pluck and eat the ripe ones; that when we perceive a stone rushing down the side of a hill, we
should be able to move so as to avoid it. And this
must be done by moving our limbs; in short, by the
use of our muscles. And thus Sensation leads, not
directly, but through the medium of Ideas, to muscular Contraction. I say that sensation and Muscular
action are in such cases connected through the medium
of Ideas. For when we proceed to pluck the grape
which we see, the <em>sensation</em> does not determine the
motion of the hand by any necessary geometrical or
mechanical conditions, as an impression made upon a
machine determines its motions; but the <em>perception</em>
leads us to stretch forth the hand to that part of space,
wherever it is, where we <em>know</em> that the grape is; and
this, not in any determinate path, but, it may be,
avoiding or removing intervening obstacles, which we
also <em>perceive</em>. There is in every such case a connexion between the sensation and the resulting action, not
of a material but of a mental kind. The cause and
the effect are bound together, not by physical but by
intellectual ties.</p>
<p id="b9c5s17">17. And thus in such cases, between the two <em>vital</em>
operations, Sensation and Muscular Action, there intervenes, as an intermediate step, Perception or Knowledge, which is not merely vital but <em>ideal</em>. But this
is not all; there is still another mental part of the
process which may be readily distinguished from that
which we have described. An act of the <em>Will</em>, a
Volition, is that, in the Mind, which immediately determines the action of the Muscles of the Body. And
thus Will intervenes between Knowledge and Action;
and the cycle of operations which take place when
animals act with reference to external objects is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page234">234</a></span> this:&#8212;Sensation, Perception, Volition, Muscular Contraction.</p>
<p id="b9c5s18">18. To attempt further to analyse the mental part
of this cycle does not belong to the present part of our
work. But we may remark here, as we have already
remarked in the History<a id="fnanchor97-9" href="#note97-9"><span class="fnanchor">97</span></a>, how irresistibly we are led
by physiological researches into the domain of thought
and mind. We pass from the body to the soul, from
physics to metaphysics; from biology to psychology;
from things to persons; from nouns to pronouns. I have
there noticed the manner in which Cuvier expresses
this transition by the introduction of the pronoun:
‘The impression of external objects upon the <span class="sc">me</span>, the
production of a sensation, of an image, is a mystery
impenetrable to our thoughts.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note97-9" href="#fnanchor97-9">97</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xvii. c. v. s. 2.</div>
<p id="b9c5s19">19. But to return to the merely biological part of
our speculations. We have arrived, it will be perceived,
at this result: that in animal actions there intervenes
between the two terms of Sensation and Muscular
Contraction, an intermediate process; which may be
described as a communication to and from a Center. The
Center is the seat of the sentient and volent faculties,
and is of a <em>hyperphysical</em> nature. But the existence of
such a Center as a necessary element in the functions of
the <em>animal</em> life is a truth which is important in biology.
This indeed may be taken as the peculiar character of
animal, as distinguished from merely <em>organic</em> powers.
Accordingly, it is so stated by Bichat. For although
he superfluously, as I have tried to show, introduces
into his list of vital powers an organic sensibility, he
still draws the distinction of which I have spoken;
‘in the animal life, Sensibility is the faculty of receiving
an Impression <em>plus</em> that of referring it to a common
Center<a id="fnanchor98-9" href="#note98-9"><span class="fnanchor">98</span></a>.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note98-9" href="#fnanchor98-9">98</a></span> <i>Life and Death</i>, p. 84.</div>
<p id="b9c5s20">20. But since Sensibility and Contractility are thus
connected by reference to a common Center, we may
ask, before quitting the subject, what are the different
forms which this reference assumes? Is the connexion <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page235">235</a></span> always attended by the distinct steps of Knowledge and
Will,&#8212;by a clear act of consciousness, as in the case
which we have taken, of plucking a grape; or may
these steps become obscure, or vanish altogether?</p>
<p>We need not further illustrate the <em>conscious</em> connexion. Such actions as we have described are called
<i>voluntary</i> actions. In extreme cases, the mental part
of the process is obvious enough. But we may gradually pass from these to cases in which the mental operation is more and more obscure.</p>
<p>In walking, in speaking, in eating, in breathing, our
muscular exertions are directed by our sensations and
perceptions: yet in such processes, how dimly are we
conscious of perceptive and directive power! How the
mind should be able to exercise such a power, and yet
should be scarcely or not at all conscious of its exercise,
is a very curious problem. But in all or in most of the
instances just mentioned, the solution of this problem
appears to depend upon psychological rather than biological principles, and therefore does not belong to this
place.</p>
<p id="b9c5s21">21. But in cases at the other extreme (unconscious
actions) the mental part of the operation vanishes altogether. In many animals, even after decapitation,
the limbs shrink when irritated. The motions of the
iris are determined by the influence of light on our
eyes, without our being aware of the motions. Here
Sensations produce Motions, but with no trace of intervening Perception or Will. The Sensation appears
to be <em>reflected</em> back from the central element of animal
life, in the form of a Muscular Contraction; but in
this case the Sensation is not modified or regulated by
any <em>Idea</em>. These reflected motions have no reference
to relations of space or force among surrounding objects. They are blind and involuntary, like the movements of convulsion, depending for direction and amount
only on the position and circumstances of the limb itself
with its muscles. Here the Centre from which the reflection takes place is merely <em>animal</em>, not intellectual.</p>
<p>In this case some physiologists have doubted whether
the reflection of the sensation in the form of a muscular <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page236">236</a></span> contraction does really take place from the Center;
and have conceived that sensorial impressions might
affect motor nerves without any communication with
the nervous Center. But on this subject we may, I
conceive, with safety adopt the decision of Professor
Müller, deliberately given after a careful examination
of the subject: ‘When impressions made by the action
of external stimuli on sensitive nerves give rise to
motions in other parts, these motions are never the
result of the <em>direct</em> reaction of the sensitive and motor
fibres of the nerves on each other; the irritation is
conveyed by the sensitive fibres to the brain and
spinal cord, and is by these communicated to the motor
fibres.’</p>
<p id="b9c5s22">22. Thus we have two extreme cases of the connexion of sensation with muscular action; in one of
which the connexion clearly <em>is</em>, and in the other it as
clearly <em>is not</em>, determined by relations of Ideas, in its
transit through the nervous Center. There is another
highly curious case standing intermediate between these
two, and extremely difficult to refer to either. I speak
of the case of <i>Instinct</i>.</p>
<p>Instinct leads to actions which are <em>such as if they
were determined by Ideas</em>. The lamb follows its mother
by instinct; but the motions by which it does this, the
special muscular exertions, depend entirely upon the
geometrical and mechanical relations of external bodies,
as the form of the ground, and the force of the wind.
The contractions of the muscles which are requisite in
order that the creature may obey its instinct, vary with
every variation of these external conditions;&#8212;are not
determined by any rule or necessity, but by properties
of Space and Force. Thus the action is not governed by
Sensations directly, but by sensations moulded by Ideas.
And the same is the case with other cases of instinct.
The dog hunts by instinct; but he hunts certain kinds
of animals merely, thus showing that his instinct acts
according to Resemblances and Differences; he crosses
the field repeatedly to find the track of his prey by
scent; thus recognizing the relations of Space with
reference to the track; he leaps, adjusting his Force to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page237">237</a></span> the distance and height of the leap with mechanical
precision; and thus he practically recognizes the Ideas
of Resemblance, Space, and Force.</p>
<p>But have animals such Ideas? In any proper sense
in which we can speak of possessing Ideas, it appears
plain that they have not. Animals cannot, at any
time, be said properly to possess ideas, for ideas imply
the possibility of <em>speculative</em> knowledge.</p>
<p id="b9c5s23">23. But even if we allow to animals only the <em>practical</em> possession of Ideas, we have still a great difficulty
remaining. In the case of man, his ideas are unfolded
gradually by his intercourse with the external world.
The child learns to distinguish forms and positions by
a repeated and incessant use of his hands and eyes; he
learns to walk, to run, to leap, by slow and laborious
degrees; he distinguishes one man from another, and
one animal from another, only after repeated mistakes.
Nor can we conceive this to be otherwise. How should
the child know at once what muscles he is to exert in
order to touch with his hand a certain visible object?
How should he know what muscles to exert that he
may stand and not fall, till he has tried often? How
should he learn to direct his attention to the differences
of different faces and persons, till he is roused by some
memory, or hope which implies memory? It seems to
us as if the sensations could not, without considerable
practice, be rightly referred to Ideas of Space, Force,
Resemblance, and the like.</p>
<p>Yet that which thus appears impossible, is in fact
done by animals. The lamb almost immediately after
its birth follows its mother, accommodating the actions
of its muscles to the form of the ground. The chick,
just escaped from the shell, picks up a minute insect,
directing its beak with the greatest accuracy. Even
the human infant seeks the breast and exerts its muscles in sucking, almost as soon as it is born. Hence,
then, we see that Instinct produces at once actions
regulated by Ideas, or, at least, which take place <em>as if</em>
they were regulated by Ideas; although the Ideas cannot have been developed by exercise, and only appear
to exist so far as such actions are concerned. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page238">238</a></span></p>
<p id="b9c5s24">24. The term <i>Instinct</i> may properly be opposed to
<i>Insight</i>. The former implies an inward principle of
action, implanted within a creature and practically
impelling it, but not capable of being developed into
a subject of contemplation. While the instinctive
actions of animals are directed by such a principle,
the deliberate actions of man are governed by insight:
he can contemplate the ideal relations on which the
result of his action depends. He can in his mind map
the path he will follow, and estimate the force he will
exert, and class the objects he has to deal with, and
determine his actions by the relations which he thus
has present to his mind. He thus possesses Ideas not
only practically, but speculatively. And knowing that
the Ideas by which he commonly directs his actions,
Space, Cause, Resemblance, and the like, have been
developed to that degree of clearness in which he possesses them by the assiduous exercise of the senses and
the mind from the earliest stage of infancy, and that
these Ideas are capable of being still further unfolded
into long trains of speculative truth, he is unable to
conceive the manner in which animals possess such
Ideas as their instinctive actions disclose:&#8212;Ideas
which neither require to be unfolded nor admit of
unfolding; which are adequate for practical purposes
without any previous exercise, and inadequate for speculative purposes with whatever labour cultivated.</p>
<p>I have ventured to make these few remarks on Instinct since it may, perhaps, justly be considered as the
last province of Biology, where we reach the boundary
line of Psychology. I have now, before quitting this
subject, only one other principle to speak of.</p>

<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b9c6s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> B</span>Y
an examination of those notions which enter
into all our reasonings and judgments on living
things, it appeared that we conceive animal life as a
vortex or cycle of moving matter in which the form of
the vortex determines the motions, and these motions
again support the form of the vortex: the stationary
parts circulate the fluids, and the fluids nourish the
permanent parts. Each portion ministers to the
others, each depends upon the other. The parts make
up the whole, but the existence of the whole is essential to the preservation of the parts. But parts existing under such conditions are <i>organs</i>, and the whole
is <i>organized</i>. This is the fundamental conception of
organization. ‘Organized beings,’ says the physiologist<a id="fnanchor99-9" href="#note99-9"><span class="fnanchor">99</span></a>,
‘are composed of a number of essential and mutually
dependent parts.’ ‘An organized product of nature,’
says the great metaphysician<a id="fnanchor100-9" href="#note100-9"><span class="fnanchor">100</span></a>, ‘is that in which all the
parts are mutually ends and means.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note99-9" href="#fnanchor99-9">99</a></span> Müller, <i>Elem.</i> p. 18.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note100-9" href="#fnanchor100-9">100</a></span> Kant, <i>Urtheilskraft</i>, p. 296.</div>
<p id="b9c6s2">2. It will be observed that we do not content ourselves with saying that in such a whole, all the parts
are <em>mutually dependent</em>. This might be true even of
a mechanical structure; it would be easy to imagine a
framework in which each part should be necessary to
the support of each of the others; for example, an arch
of several stones. But in such a structure, the parts
have no properties which they derive from the whole.
They are beams or stones when separate; they are no
more when joined. But the same is not the case in an
organized whole. The limb of an animal separated <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page240">240</a></span>
from the body, loses the properties of a limb, and soon
ceases to retain even its form.</p>
<p id="b9c6s3">3. Nor do we content ourselves with saying that
the parts are <em>mutually causes and effects</em>. This is the
case in machinery. In a clock, the pendulum by means
of the escapement causes the descent of the weight, the
weight by the same escapement keeps up the motion
of the pendulum. But things of this kind may happen
by accident. Stones slide from a rock down the side
of a hill and cause it to be smooth; the smoothness of
the slope causes stones still to slide. Yet no one would
call such a slide an organized system. The system is
organized, when the effects which take place among the
parts are <em>essential to our conception of the whole</em>; when
the whole would not <em>be</em> a whole, nor the parts, parts,
except these effects were produced; when the effects
not only happen in fact, but are included in the idea
of the object; when they are not only seen, but foreseen; not only expected, but intended: in short when,
instead of being causes and effects, they are <em>ends</em> and
<em>means</em>, as they are termed in the above definition.</p>
<p>Thus we necessarily include, in our Idea of Organization, the notion of an End, a Purpose, a Design;
or, to use another phrase which has been peculiarly
appropriated in this case, a <i>Final Cause</i>. This idea of
a Final Cause is an essential condition in order to the
pursuing our researches respecting organized bodies.</p>
<p id="b9c6s4">4. This Idea of Final Cause is not <em>deduced</em> from
the phenomena by reasoning, but is <em>assumed</em> as the
only condition under which we can reason on such subjects at all. We do not deduce the Idea of Space, or
Time, or efficient Cause from the phenomena about us,
but necessarily look at phenomena as subordinate to
these Ideas from the beginning of our reasoning. It
is true, our ideas of relations of Space, and Time, and
Force, may become much more clear by our familiarizing ourselves with particular phenomena: but still,
the Fundamental Ideas are not generated, but unfolded; not extracted from the external world, but
evolved from the world within. In like manner, in
the contemplation of organic structures, we consider <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page241">241</a></span> each part as subservient to some use, and we cannot
study the structure as organic without such a conception.
This notion of adaptation,&#8212;this Idea of an End,&#8212;may
become much more clear and impressive by seeing it
exemplified in particular cases. But still, though suggested and evoked by special cases, it is not furnished
by them. If it be not supplied by the mind itself, it
can never be logically deduced from the phenomena.
It is not a portion of the facts which we study, but it
is a principle which connects, includes, and renders
them intelligible; as our other Fundamental Ideas do
the classes of facts to which they respectively apply.</p>
<p id="b9c6s5">5. This has already been confirmed by reference to
fact; in the History of Physiology, I have shown that
those who studied the structure of animals were irresistibly led to the conviction that the parts of this
structure have each its end or purpose;&#8212;that each
member and organ not merely produces a certain
effect or answers a certain use, but is so framed as
to impress us with the persuasion that it was constructed <em>for</em> that use:&#8212;that it was <em>intended</em> to produce the effect. It was there seen that this persuasion was repeatedly expressed in the most emphatic
manner by Galen;&#8212;that it directed the researches and
led to the discoveries of Harvey;&#8212;that it has always
been dwelt upon as a favourite contemplation, and followed as a certain guide, by the best anatomists;&#8212;and
that it is inculcated by the physiologists of the profoundest views and most extensive knowledge of our
own time. All these persons have deemed it a most
certain and important principle of physiology, that in
every organized structure, plant or animal, each intelligible part has its allotted office:&#8212;each organ is designed for its appropriate function:&#8212;that nature, in
these cases, produces nothing in vain: that, in short,
each portion of the whole arrangement has its <em>final
cause</em>; an End to which it is adapted, and in this End,
the reason that it is where and what it is.</p>
<p id="b9c6s6">6. This Notion of Design in organized bodies must,
I say, be supplied by the student of organization out of
his own mind: a truth which will become clearer if <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page242">242</a></span> we attend to the most conspicuous and acknowledged
instances of <em>design</em>. The structure of the Eye, in which
the parts are curiously adjusted so as to produce a distinct image on the retina, as in an optical instrument;&#8212;the Trochlear Muscle of the eye, in which the tendon
passes round a support and turns back, like a rope
round a pulley;&#8212;the prospective contrivances for the
preservation of animals, provided long before they are
wanted, as the Milk of the mother, the Teeth of the
child, the Eyes and Lungs of the fœtus:&#8212;these arrangements, and innumerable others, call up in us a persuasion that Design has entered into the plan of animal
form and progress. And if we bring in our minds
this conception of Design, nothing can more fully
square with and fit it, than such instances as these.
But if we did not already possess the Idea of Design;&#8212;if we had not had our notion of mechanical contrivance awakened by inspection of optical instruments,
or pulleys, or in some other way:&#8212;if we had never
been conscious ourselves of providing for the future;&#8212;if this were the case, we could not recognize contrivance and prospectiveness in such instances as we have
referred to. The facts are, indeed, admirably in accordance with these conceptions, when the two are
brought together: but the facts and the conceptions
come together from different quarters&#8212;from without
and from within.</p>
<p id="b9c6s7">7. We may further illustrate this point by referring
to the relations of travellers who tell us that when
consummate examples of human mechanical contrivance have been set before savages, they have appeared incapable of apprehending them as proofs of
design. This shows that in such cases the Idea of
Design had not been developed in the minds of the
people who were thus unintelligent: but it no more
proves that such an idea does not naturally and necessarily arise, in the progress of men’s minds, than the
confused manner in which the same savages apprehend
the relations of space, or number, or cause, proves that
these ideas do not naturally belong to their intellects.
All men have these ideas; and it is because they <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page243">243</a></span> cannot help referring their sensations to such ideas, that
they apprehend the world as existing in time and
space, and as a series of causes and effects. It would
be very erroneous to say that the belief of such truths
is obtained by logical reasoning from facts. And in
like manner we cannot logically deduce design from
the contemplation of organic structures; although it is
impossible for us, when the facts are clearly before us,
not to find a reference to design operating in our minds.</p>
<p id="b9c6s8">8. Again; the evidence of the doctrine of Final
Causes as a fundamental principle of Biology may be
obscured and weakened in some minds by the constant
habit of viewing this doctrine with suspicion as unphilosophical and at variance with Morphology. By cherishing such views, it is probable that many persons,
physiologists and others, have gradually brought themselves to suppose that many or most of the arrangements which are familiarly adduced as instances of design may be accounted for, or explained away;&#8212;that
there is a certain degree of prejudice and narrowness
of comprehension in that lively admiration of the
adaptation of means to ends which common minds
derive from the spectacle of organic arrangements.
And yet, even in persons accustomed to these views,
the strong and natural influence of the Idea of a Final
Cause, the spontaneous recognition of the relation of
Means to an End as the assumption which makes organic arrangements intelligible, breaks forth when we
bring before them a new case, with regard to which
their genuine convictions have not yet been modified
by their intellectual habits. I will offer, as an example
which may serve to illustrate this, the discoveries recently made with regard to the process of Suckling in
the Kangaroo. In the case of this, as of other pouched
animals, the young animal is removed, while very
small and imperfectly formed, from the womb to the
pouch, in which the teats are, and is there placed
with its lips against one of the nipples. But the
young animal taken altogether is not so large as the
nipple, and is therefore incapable of sucking after the
manner of common mammals. Here is a difficulty: <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page244">244</a></span> how is it overcome?&#8212;By an appropriate <em>contrivance</em>:
the nipple, which in common mammals is not furnished
with any muscle, is in the kangaroo provided with a
powerful extrusory muscle by which the mother can
inject the milk into the mouth of her offspring. And
again; in order to give attachment to this muscle
there is a bone which is not found in animals of
other kinds. But this mode of solving the problem
of suckling so small a creature introduces another
difficulty. If the milk is injected into the mouth of
the young one, without any action of its own muscles,
what is to prevent the fluid entering the windpipe and
producing suffocation? How is this danger avoided?&#8212;By another appropriate <em>contrivance</em>: there is a funnel
in the back of the throat by which the air passage is
completely separated from the passage for nutriment,
and the injected milk passes in a divided stream on
each side of the larynx to the œsophagus<a id="fnanchor101-9" href="#note101-9"><span class="fnanchor">101</span></a>. And as if
to show that this apparatus is really formed with a
view to the wants of the young one, the structure
alters in the course of the animal’s growth; and the
funnel, no longer needed, is modified and disappears.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note101-9" href="#fnanchor101-9">101</a></span> Mr. Owen, in <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1834, p. 348.</div>
<p id="b9c6s9"><span class="correction" title="Article number inserted and subsequent numbers adjusted">9.</span> With regard to this and similar examples, the remark which I would urge is this:&#8212;that no one, however prejudiced or unphilosophical he may in general
deem the reference to Final Causes, can, at the first
impression, help regarding this curious system of arrangement as the Means to an End. So contemplated,
it becomes significant, intelligible, admirable: without
such a principle, it is an unmeaning complexity, a collection of contradictions, producing an almost impossible result by a portentous conflict of chances. The
parts of this apparatus cannot have produced one another: one part is in the mother; another part in the
young one: without their harmony they could not be
effective; but nothing except design can operate to
make them harmonious. They are <em>intended</em> to work
together; and we cannot resist the conviction of this
intention when the facts first come before us. Perhaps <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page245">245</a></span> there may hereafter be physiologists who, tracing the
gradual development of the parts of which we have
spoken, and the analogies which connect them with
the structures of other animals, may think that this
development, these analogies, account for the conformation we have described; and may hence think
lightly of the explanation derived from the reference
to Final Causes. Yet surely it is clear, on a calm
consideration of the subject, that the latter explanation is not disturbed by the former; and that the observer’s first impression, that this is ‘an irrefragable
evidence of creative foresight<a id="fnanchor102-9" href="#note102-9"><span class="fnanchor">102</span></a>,’ can never be obliterated; however much it may be obscured in the
minds of those who confuse this view by mixing it
with others which are utterly heterogeneous to it, and
therefore cannot be contradictory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note102-9" href="#fnanchor102-9">102</a></span> Mr. Owen, in <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1834, p. 349.</div>
<p id="b9c6s10">10. I have elsewhere<a id="fnanchor103-9" href="#note103-9"><span class="fnanchor">103</span></a> remarked how physiologists,
who thus look with suspicion and dislike upon the
introduction of Final Causes into physiology, have still
been unable to exclude from their speculations causes
of this kind. Thus Cabanis says<a id="fnanchor104-9" href="#note104-9"><span class="fnanchor">104</span></a>, ‘I regard with the
great Bacon, the philosophy of Final Causes as sterile;
but I have elsewhere acknowledged that it was very
difficult for the most cautious man never to have
recourse to them in his explanations.’ Accordingly, he
says, ‘The partisans of Final Causes nowhere find arguments so strong in favour of their way of looking at
nature as in the laws which preside and the circumstances of all kinds which concur in the reproduction
of living races. In no case do the means employed
appear so clearly relative to the end.’ And it would
be easy to find similar acknowledgments, express or
virtual, in other writers of the same kind. Thus
Bichat, after noting the difference between the organic
sensibility by which the organs are made to perform
their offices, and the animal sensibility of which the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page246">246</a></span> nervous center is the seat, says<a id="fnanchor105-9" href="#note105-9"><span class="fnanchor">105</span></a>, ‘No doubt it will be
asked, <em>why</em>‘&#8212;that is, as we shall see, for what <em>end</em>&#8212;‘the organs of internal life have received from nature
an inferior degree of sensibility only, and why they do
not transmit to the brain the impressions which they
receive, while all the acts of the animal life imply this
transmission? The reason is simply this, that all the
phenomena which establish our connexions with surrounding objects <em>ought to be</em>, and are in fact, under the
influence of the Will; while all those which serve for
the purpose of assimilation only, escape, and <em>ought</em>
indeed to escape, such influence.’ The <em>reason</em> here
assigned is the Final Cause; which, as Bichat justly
says, we cannot help asking for.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note103-9" href="#fnanchor103-9">103</a></span> <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, p. 352.</div>

<p id="b9c6s11">11. Again; I may quote from the writer last mentioned another remark, which shows that in the organical sciences, and in them alone, the Idea of forces as
Means acting to an End, is inevitably assumed and
acknowledged as of supreme authority. In Biology
alone, observes Bichat<a id="fnanchor106-9" href="#note106-9"><span class="fnanchor">106</span></a>, have we to contemplate the
state of <em>Disease</em>. ‘Physiology is to the movements of
living bodies, what astronomy, dynamics, hydraulics,
&amp;e., are to those of inert matter: but these latter
sciences have no branches which correspond to them
as Pathology corresponds to Physiology. For the same
reason all notion of a Medicament is repugnant to the
physical sciences. A Medicament has for its object
to bring the properties of the system back to their
Natural Type; but the physical properties never depart
from this Type, and have no need to be brought back to
it: and thus there is nothing in the physical sciences
which holds the place of Therapeutick in Physiology.’
Or, as we might express it otherwise, of inert forces
we have no conception of what they <em>ought to do</em>,
except what they <em>do</em>. The forces of gravity, elasticity,
affinity, never act in a <em>diseased</em> manner; we never
conceive them as failing in their purpose; for we do
not conceive them as having any purpose which is
answered by one mode of their action rather than <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page247">247</a></span> another. But with <em>organical</em> forces the case is different; they are necessarily conceived as acting for the
preservation and development of the system in which
they reside. If they do not do this, they fail, they
are deranged, diseased. They have for their object
to conform the living being to a certain type; and if
they cause or allow it to deviate from this type, their
action is distorted, morbid, contrary to the ends of
nature. And thus this conception of organized beings
as susceptible of disease, implies the recognition of a
state of health, and of the organs and the vital forces
as means for preserving this normal condition. The
state of health, and of perpetual development, is
necessarily contemplated as the Final Cause of the processes and powers with which the different parts of
plants and animals are endowed.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note106-9" href="#fnanchor106-9">106</a></span> <i>Anatomie Générale</i>, i. liii.</div>
<p id="b9c6s12">12. This Idea of a Final Cause is applicable as a
fundamental and regulative idea to our speculations
concerning organized creatures only. That there is a
purpose in many other parts of the creation, we find
abundant reason to believe, from the arrangements
and laws which prevail around us. But this persuasion is not to be allowed to regulate and direct our
reasonings with regard to inorganic matter, of which
conception the relation of means and end forms no
essential part. In mere Physics, Final Causes, as
Bacon has observed, are not to be admitted as a principle of reasoning. But in the organical sciences, the
assumption of design and purpose in every part of
every whole, that is, the pervading idea of Final Cause,
is the basis of sound reasoning and the source of true
doctrine.</p>
<p id="b9c6s13">13. The Idea of Final Cause, of end, purpose,
design, intention, is altogether different from the Idea
of Cause, as Efficient Cause, which we formerly had to
consider; and on this account the use of the word
Cause in this phrase has been objected to. If the idea
be clearly entertained and steadily applied, the word is
a question of subordinate importance. The term Final
Cause has been long familiarly used, and appears not
likely to lead to confusion. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page248">248</a></span></p>
<p id="b9c6s14">14. The consideration of Final Causes, both in physiology and in other subjects, has at all times attracted
much attention, in consequence of its bearing upon the
belief of an Intelligent Author of the Universe. I do
not intend, in this place, to pursue the subject far in
this view: but there is one antithesis of opinion,
already noticed in the History of Physiology, on which
I will again make a few remarks<a id="fnanchor107-9" href="#note107-9"><span class="fnanchor">107</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note107-9" href="#fnanchor107-9">107</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xvii. c. viii. On the Doctrine of Final Causes in Physiology.</div>
<p>It has appeared to some persons that the mere
aspect of order and symmetry in the works of nature&#8212;the contemplation of comprehensive and consistent
law&#8212;is sufficient to lead us to the conception of a
design and intelligence producing the order and carrying into effect the law. Without here attempting to
decide whether this is true, we may discern, after what
has been said, that the conception of Design, arrived
at in this manner, is altogether different from that Idea
of Design which is suggested to us by organized bodies,
and which we describe as the doctrine of Final Causes.
The regular form of a crystal, whatever beautiful symmetry it may exhibit, whatever general laws it may
exemplify, does not prove design in the same manner in
which design is proved by the provisions for the preservation and growth of the seeds of plants, and of the
young of animals. The law of universal gravitation,
however wide and simple, does not impress us with the
belief of a purpose, as does that propensity by which
the two sexes of each animal are brought together. If
it could be shown that the symmetrical structure of a
flower results from laws of the same kind as those
which determine the regular forms of crystals, or the
motions of the planets, the discovery might be very
striking and important, but it would not at all come
under our idea of Final Cause.</p>
<p id="b9c6s15">15. Accordingly, there have been, in modern times,
two different schools of physiologists, the one proceeding upon the idea of Final Causes, the other school <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page249">249</a></span> seeking in the realm of organized bodies wide laws and
analogies from which that idea is excluded. All the
great biologists of preceding times, and some of the
greatest of modern times, have belonged to the former
school; and especially Cuvier, who may be considered
as the head of it. It was solely by the assiduous application of this principle of Final Cause, as he himself
constantly declared, that he was enabled to make the
discoveries which have rendered his name so illustrious,
and which contain a far larger portion of important
anatomical and biological truth than it ever before fell
to the lot of one man to contribute to the science.</p>
<p>The opinions which have been put in opposition to
the principle of Final Causes have, for the most part,
been stated vaguely and ambiguously. Among the
most definite of such principles, is that which, in the
History of the subject, I have termed the Principle of
Metamorphosed and Developed Symmetry, upon which
has been founded the science of Morphology.</p>
<p>The reality and importance of this principle are not
to be denied by us: we have shown how they are
proved by its application in various sciences, and especially in botany. But those advocates of this principle
who have placed it in antithesis to the doctrine of
Final Causes, have, by this means, done far more injustice to their own favourite doctrine than damage to
the one which they opposed. The adaptation of the
bones of the skeleton to the muscles, the provision of
fulcrums, projecting processes, channels, so that the
motions and forces shall be such as the needs of life
require, cannot possibly become less striking and convincing, from any discovery of general analogies of one
animal frame with another, or of laws connecting the
development of different parts. Whenever such laws
are discovered, we can only consider them as the means
of producing that adaptation which we so much admire.
Our conviction that the Artist works intelligently, is
not destroyed, though it may be modified and transferred, when we obtain a sight of his tools. Our discovery of laws cannot contradict our persuasion of
ends; our Morphology cannot prejudice our Teleology. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page250">250</a></span></p>
<p id="b9c6s16">16. The irresistible and constant apprehension of a
purpose in the forms and functions of animals has introduced into the writings of speculators on these subjects various forms of expression, more or less precise,
more or less figurative; as, that ‘animals are framed
with a view to the part which they have to play;’&#8212;that ‘nature does nothing in vain;’ that ‘she employs
the best means for her ends;’ and the like. However
metaphorical or inexact any of these phrases may be
in particular, yet taken altogether, they convey, clearly
and definitely enough to preclude any serious errour,
a principle of the most profound reality and of the
highest importance in the organical sciences. But
some adherents of the morphological school of which
1 have spoken reject, and even ridicule, all such modes
of expression. ‘I know nothing,’ says M. Geoffroy
Saint Hilaire, ‘of animals which have to play a part in
nature. I cannot make of nature an intelligent being
who does nothing in vain; who acts by the shortest
mode; who does all for the best.’ The philosophers of this
school, therefore, do not, it would seem, feel any of the
admiration which is irresistibly excited in all the rest of
mankind at the contemplation of the various and wonderful adaptations for the preservation, the enjoyment,
the continuation of the creatures which people the globe;&#8212;at the survey of the mechanical contrivances, the
chemical agencies, the prospective arrangements, the
compensations, the minute adaptations, the comprehensive interdependencies, which zoology and physiology
have brought into view, more and more, the further their
researches have been carried. Yet the clear and deep-seated conviction of the reality of these provisions,
which the study of anatomy produces in its most profound and accurate cultivators, cannot be shaken by
any objections to the metaphors or terms in which this
conviction is clothed. In regard to the Idea of a Purpose in organization, as in regard to any other idea, we
cannot fully express our meaning by phrases borrowed
from any extraneous source; but that impossibility
arises precisely from the circumstance of its being a
Fundamental Idea which is inevitably assumed in our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page251">251</a></span> representation of each special fact. The same objection
has been made to the idea of mechanical <i>force</i>, on account of its being often expressed in metaphorical language; for writers have spoken of an <i>energy</i>, <i>effort</i>, or
<i>solicitation</i> to motion; and bodies have been said to be
<i>animated</i> by a force. Such language, it has been urged,
implies volition, and the act of animated beings. But
the idea of Force as distinct from mere motion,&#8212;as
the Cause of motion, or of tendency to motion,&#8212;is not
on that account less real. We endeavour in vain to
conduct our mechanical reasonings without the aid of
this idea, and must express it as we can. Just as
little can we reason concerning organized beings without assuming that each part has its function, each
function its purpose; and so far as our phrases imply this, they will not mislead us, however inexact,
or however figurative they be.</p>
<p id="b9c6s17">17. The doctrine of a purpose in Organization has
been sometimes called the doctrine of <i>the Conditions of
Existence</i>; and has been stated as teaching that each
animal must be so framed as to contain in its structure
the Conditions which its existence requires. When
expressed in this manner, it has given rise to the objection, that it merely offers an identical proposition;
since no animal can exist without such conditions.
But in reality, such expressions as those just quoted
give an inadequate statement of the Principle of a
Final Cause. For we discover in innumerable cases,
arrangements in an animal, of which we see, indeed,
that they are subservient to its well being; but the
nature of which we never should have been able at all
to conjecture, from considering what was necessary to
its existence, and which strike us, no less by their unexpectedness than by their adaptation: so far are they
from being presented by any perceptible necessity.
Who would venture to say that the trochlear muscle,
or the power of articulate speech, must occur in man,
because they are the necessary conditions of his existence? When, indeed, the general scheme and mode of
being of an animal are known, the expert and profound
anatomist can reason concerning the proportions and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page252">252</a></span> form of its various parts and organs, and prove in some
measure what their relations must be. We can assert,
with Cuvier, that certain forms of the viscera require
certain forms of the teeth, certain forms of the limbs,
certain powers of the senses. But in all this, the functions of self-nutrition and digestion are supposed already existing as ends: and it being taken for granted,
as the only conceivable basis of reasoning, that the
organs are means to these ends, we may discover what
modifications of these organs are necessarily related to
and connected with each other. Instead of terming
this rule of speculation merely ‘the Principle of the
Conditions of Existence,’ we might term it ‘the Principle of the conditions of organs as <em>Means</em> adapted to
animal existence as their <em>End</em>.’ And how far this
principle is from being a mere barren truism, the
extraordinary discoveries made by the great assertor
of the principle, and universally assented to by naturalists, abundantly prove. The vast extinct creation
which is recalled to life in Cuvier’s great work, the
<i>Ossemens Fossiles</i>, cannot be the consequence of a mere
identical proposition.</p>
<p id="b9c6s18">18. It has been objected, also, that the doctrine of
Final Causes supposes us to be acquainted with the
intentions of the Creator; which, it is insinuated, is a
most presumptuous and irrational basis for our reasonings. But there can be nothing presumptuous or irrational in reasoning on that basis, which if we reject,
we cannot reason at all. If men really can discern,
and cannot help discerning, a design in certain portions of the works of creation, this perception is the
soundest and most satisfactory ground for the convictions to which it leads. The Ideas which we necessarily employ in the contemplation of the world around
us, afford us the only natural means of forming any
conception of the Creator and Governor of the Universe; and if we are by such means enabled to elevate
our thoughts, however inadequately, towards Him,
where is the presumption of doing so? or rather,
where is the wisdom of refusing to open our minds
to contemplations so animating and elevating, and yet <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page253">253</a></span> so entirely convincing? We possess the ideas of Time
and Space, under which all the objects of the universe
present themselves to us; and in virtue of these ideas
thus possessed, we believe the Creator to be eternal
and omnipotent. When we find that we, in like manner, possess the idea of a Design in Creation, and that
with regard to ourselves, and creatures more or less
resembling ourselves, we cannot but contemplate their
constitution under this idea, we cannot abstain from
ascribing to the Creator the infinite profundity and
extent of design to which all these special instances
belong as parts of a whole.</p>
<p id="b9c6s19">19. I have here considered Design as manifest in
organization only: for in that field of speculation it is
forced upon us as contained in all the phenomena, and
as the only mode of our understanding them. The
existence of Final Causes has often been pointed out
in other portions of the creation;&#8212;for instance, in the
apparent adaptations of the various parts of the earth
and of the solar system to each other and to organized
beings. In these provinces of speculation, however,
the principle of Final Causes is no longer the basis
and guide, but the sequel and result of our physical
reasonings. If in looking at the universe, we follow
the widest analogies of which we obtain a view, we
see, however dimly, reason to believe that all its laws
are adapted to each other, and intended to work together for the benefit of its organic population, and for
the general welfare of its rational tenants. On this
subject, however, not immediately included in the principle of Final Causes as here stated, I shall not dwell.
I will only make this remark; that the assertion appears to be quite unfounded, that as science advances
from point to point, Final Causes recede before it, and
disappear one after the other. The principle of design
changes its mode of application indeed, but it loses
none of its force. We no longer consider particular
facts as produced by special interpositions, but we
consider design as exhibited in the establishment and
adjustment of the laws by which particular facts
are produced. We do not look upon each particular <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page254">254</a></span> cloud as brought near us that it may drop fatness
on our fields; but the general adaptation of the laws
of heat, and air, and moisture, to the promotion of
vegetation, does not become doubtful. We do not
consider the sun as less intended to warm and vivify
the tribes of plants and animals, because we find that,
instead of revolving round the earth as an attendant,
the earth along with other planets revolves round him.
We are rather, by the discovery of the general laws
of nature, led into a scene of wider design, of deeper
contrivance, of more comprehensive adjustments. Final
causes, if they appear driven further from us by such
an extension of our views, embrace us only with a
vaster and more majestic circuit: instead of a few
threads’ connecting some detached objects, they become a stupendous net-work, which is wound round
and round the universal frame of things.</p>
<p id="b9c6s20">20. I now quit the subject of Biology, and with it
the circle of sciences depending upon separate original
Ideas and permanent relations. If from the general
relations which permanently prevail and constantly
recur among the objects around us, we turn to the
inquiry of what has actually happened,&#8212;if from Science we turn to History,&#8212;we find ourselves in a new
field. In this region of speculation we can rarely
obtain a complete and scientific view of the connexion between objects and events. The past History
of Man, of the Arts, of Languages, of the Earth, of
the Solar System, offers a vast series of problems, of
which perhaps not one has been rigorously solved.
Still, man, as his speculative powers unfold themselves,
cannot but feel prompted and invited to employ his
thoughts even on these problems. He cannot but
wish and endeavour to understand the connexion between the successive links of such chains of events.
He attempts to form a Science which shall be applicable to each of these Histories; and thus he begins to
construct the class of sciences to which I now, in the
last place, proceed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of Palætiological Sciences in General.</span></h3>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p class="noind" id="b10c1s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> I</span> HAVE
already stated in the <i>History of the
Sciences</i><a id="fnanchor1-10" href="#note1-10"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>, that the class of Sciences which I
designate as <i>Palætiological</i> are those in which the object is to ascend from the present state of things to a
more ancient condition, from which the present is derived by intelligible causes. As conspicuous examples
of this class we may take Geology, Glossology or
Comparative Philology, and Comparative Archæology.
These provinces of knowledge might perhaps be intelligibly described as <i>Histories</i>; the History of the
Earth,&#8212;the History of Languages,&#8212;the History of
Arts. But these phrases would not fully describe
the sciences we have in view; for the object to which
we now suppose their investigations to be directed is,
not merely to ascertain what the series of events has
been, as in the common forms of History, but also how
it has been brought about. These sciences are to treat
of causes as well as of effects. Such researches might
be termed <i>Philosophical History</i>; or, in order to mark
more distinctly that the <em>causes</em> of events are the leading object of attention, <i>Ætiological History</i>. But since <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page258">258</a></span> it will be more convenient to describe this class of
sciences by a single appellation, I have taken the liberty
of proposing to call them<a id="fnanchor2-10" href="#note2-10"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> the <i>Palætiological</i> Sciences.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-10" href="#fnanchor1-10">1</a></span> B. xviii. Introd.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-10" href="#fnanchor2-10">2</a></span> A philological writer, in a very
interesting work (Mr. Donaldson, in
his <i>New Cratylus</i>, p. 12), expresses
his dislike of this word, and suggests
that I must mean <i>palæ-ætiological</i>.
I think the word is more likely
to obtain currency in the more compact and euphonious form in which
I have used it. It has been adopted
by Mr. Winning, in his <i>Manual of
Comparative Philology</i>, and more recently, by other writers.</div>
<p>While Palæontology describes the beings which have
lived in former ages without investigating their causes,
and <i>Ætiology</i> treats of causes without distinguishing
historical from mechanical causation; <i>Palætiology</i> is a
combination of the two sciences; exploring, by means
of the second, the phenomena presented by the first.
The portions of knowledge which I include in this term
are palæontological ætiological sciences.</p>
<p id="b10c1s2">2. All these sciences are connected by this bond;&#8212;that they all endeavour to ascend to a past state, by
considering what is the present state of things, and
what are the causes of change. Geology examines the
existing appearance of the materials which form the
earth, infers from them previous conditions, and speculates concerning the forces by which one condition has
been made to succeed another. Another science, cultivated with great zeal and success in modern times,
compares the languages of different countries and nations, and by an examination of their materials and
structure, endeavours to determine their descent from
one another: this science has been termed <i>Comparative Philology</i>, or <i>Ethnography</i>; and by the French,
<i>Linguistique</i>, a word which we might imitate in order
to have a single name for the science, but the Greek
derivative <i>Glossology</i> appears to be more convenient in
its form. The progress of the Arts (Architecture and the
like);&#8212;how one stage of the culture produced another;
and how far we can trace their maturest and most complete condition to their earliest form in various nations;&#8212;are problems of great interest belonging to another
subject, which we may for the present term <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page259">259</a></span> <i>Comparative Archæology</i>. I have already noticed, in the History<a id="fnanchor3-10" href="#note3-10"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> how the researches into the origin of natural
objects, and those relating to works of art, pass by
slight gradations into each other; how the examination of the changes which have affected an ancient
temple or fortress, harbour or river, may concern alike
the geologist and the antiquary. Cuvier’s assertion
that the geologist is an antiquary of a new order, is
perfectly correct, for both are palætiologists.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-10" href="#fnanchor3-10">3</a></span> B. xviii. Introd.</div>
<p id="b10c1s3">3. We are very far from having exhausted, by this
enumeration, the class of sciences which are thus connected. We may easily point out many other subjects
of speculation of the same kind. As we may look back
towards the first condition of our planet, we may in
like manner turn our thoughts towards the first condition of the solar system, and try whether we can discern any traces of an order of things antecedent to that
which is now established; and if we find, as some great
mathematicians have conceived, indications of an earlier
state in which the planets were not yet gathered into
their present forms, we have, in the pursuit of this
train of research, a palætiological portion of Astronomy.
Again, as we may inquire how languages, and how
man, have been diffused over the earth’s surface from
place to place, we may make the like inquiry with
regard to the races of plants and animals, founding
our inferences upon the existing geographical distribution of the animal and vegetable kingdoms: and
thus the Geography of Plants and of Animals also
becomes a portion of Palætiology. Again, as we can
in some measure trace the progress of Arts from nation
to nation and from age to age, we can also pursue a
similar investigation with respect to the progress of
Mythology, of Poetry, of Government, of Law. Thus
the philosophical history of the human race, viewed
with reference to these subjects, if it can give rise to
knowledge so exact as to be properly called Science,
will supply Sciences belonging to the class I am now to
consider. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page260">260</a></span></p>
<p id="b10c1s4">4. It is not an arbitrary and useless proceeding to
construct such a Class of Sciences. For wide and various as their subjects are, it will be found that they
have all certain principles, maxims, and rules of procedure in common; and thus may reflect light upon each
other by being treated of together. Indeed it will,
I trust, appear, that we may by such a juxtaposition
of different speculations, obtain most salutary lessons.
And questions, which, when viewed as they first present themselves under the aspect of a special science,
disturb and alarm men’s minds, may perhaps be contemplated more calmly, as well as more clearly, when
they are considered as general problems of palætiology.</p>
<p id="b10c1s5">5. It will at once occur to the reader that, if we
include in the circuit of our classification such subjects
as have been mentioned,&#8212;politics and law, mythology
and poetry,&#8212;we are travelling very far beyond the
material sciences within whose limits we at the outset
proposed to confine our discussion of principles. But
we shall remain faithful to our original plan; and for
that purpose shall confine ourselves, in this work, to
those palætiological sciences which deal with material
things. It is true, that the general principles and
maxims which regulate these sciences apply also to investigations of a parallel kind respecting the products
which result from man’s imaginative and social endowments. But although there may be a similarity in the
general form of such portions of knowledge, their materials are so different from those with which we have
been hitherto dealing, that we cannot hope to take
them into our present account with any profit. Language, Government, Law, Poetry, Art, embrace a number of peculiar Fundamental Ideas, hitherto not touched
upon in the disquisitions in which we have been engaged; and most of them involved in far greater perplexity and ambiguity, the subject of controversies far
more vehement, than the Ideas we have hitherto been
examining. We must therefore avoid resting any part
of our philosophy upon sciences, or supposed sciences,
which treat of such subjects. To attend to this caution, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page261">261</a></span> is the only way in which we can secure the advantage
we proposed to ourselves at the outset, of taking, as
the basis of our speculations, none but systems of undisputed truths, clearly understood and expressed<a id="fnanchor4-10" href="#note4-10"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>.
We have already said that we must, knowingly and
voluntarily, resign that livelier and warmer interest
which doctrines on subjects of Polity or Art possess,
and content ourselves with the cold truths of the
material sciences, in order that we may avoid having
the very foundations of our philosophy involved in controversy, doubt, and obscurity.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-10" href="#fnanchor4-10">4</a></span> See Introd. <a href="#v1page9">p. 9</a>.</div>
<p id="b10c1s6">6. We may remark, however, that the necessity of
rejecting from our survey a large portion of the researches which the general notion of Palætiology includes, suggests one consideration which adds to the
interest of our task. We began our inquiry with the
trust that any sound views which we should be able
to obtain respecting the nature of Truth in the physical sciences, and the mode of discovering it, must
also tend to throw light upon the nature and prospects of knowledge of all other kinds;&#8212;must be
useful to us in moral, political, and philological researches. We stated this as a confident anticipation;
and the evidence of the justice of our belief already
begins to appear. We have seen, in the last Book, that
biology leads us to psychology, if we choose to follow
the path; and thus the passage from the material to
the immaterial has already unfolded itself at one point;
and we now perceive that there are several large provinces of speculation which concern subjects belonging
to man’s immaterial nature, and which are governed
by the same laws as sciences altogether physical. It
is not our business here to dwell on the prospects
which our philosophy thus opens to our contemplation; but we may allow ourselves, in this last stage
of our pilgrimage among the foundations of the physical sciences, to be cheered and animated by the ray <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page262">262</a></span> that thus beams upon us, however dimly, from a
higher and brighter region.</p>
<p>But in our reasonings and examples we shall mainly
confine ourselves to the physical sciences; and for the
most part to Geology, which in the <i>History</i> I have put
forwards as the best representative of the Palætiological Sciences.</p>
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page263"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Three Members of a Palætiological Science.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b10c2s1">1. <i>Divisions of such Sciences.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">In</span> each of the Sciences of this class we consider some particular order
of phenomena now existing:&#8212;from our knowledge of
the causes of change among such phenomena, we endeavour to infer the causes which have made this order of
things what it is:&#8212;we ascend in this manner to some
previous stage of such phenomena;&#8212;and from that, by
a similar course of inference, to a still earlier stage,
and to its causes. Hence it will be seen that each
such science will consist of two parts,&#8212;the knowledge
of the Phenomena, and the knowledge of their Causes.
And such a division is, in fact, generally recognized
in such sciences: thus we have History, and the Philosophy of History; we have Comparison of Languages, and the Theories of the Origin and Progress
of Language; we have Descriptive Geology, and
Theoretical or Physical Geology. In all these cases,
the relation between the two parts in these several
provinces of knowledge is nearly the same; and it may,
on some occasions at least, be useful to express the
distinction in a uniform or general manner. The investigation of Causes has been termed <i>Ætiology</i> by
philosophical writers, and this term we may use, in
contradistinction to the mere <i>Phenomenology</i> of each
such department of knowledge. And thus we should
have <i>Phenomenal Geology</i> and <i>Ætiological Geology</i>, for
the two divisions of the science which we have above
termed <i>Descriptive</i> and <i>Theoretical Geology</i>.</p>
<p id="b10c2s2">2. <i>The Study of Causes.</i>&#8212;But our knowledge respecting the causes which actually <em>have</em> produced any <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page264">264</a></span> order of phenomena must be arrived at by ascertaining what the causes of change in such matters <em>can</em>
do. In order to learn, for example, what share earthquakes, and volcanoes, and the beating of the ocean
against its shores, ought to have in our Theory of
Geology, we must make out what effects these agents
of change are able to produce. And this must be
done, not hastily, or unsystematically, but in a careful and connected manner; in short, this study of
the causes of change in each order of phenomena must
become a distinct body of Science, which must include
a large amount of knowledge, both comprehensive and
precise, before it can be applied to the construction of
a theory. We must have an Ætiology corresponding
to each order of phenomena.</p>
<p id="b10c2s3">3. <i>Ætiology.</i>&#8212;In the History of Geology, I have
spoken of the necessity for such an Ætiology with
regard to geological phenomena: this necessity I have
compared with that which, at the time of Kepler, required the formation of a separate science of Dynamics
(the doctrine of the Causes of Motion), before Physical
Astronomy could grow out of Phenomenal Astronomy.
In pursuance of this analogy, I have there given the
name of <i>Geological Dynamics</i> to the science which
treats of the causes of geological change in general.
But, as I have there intimated, in a large portion of
the subject the changes are so utterly different in their
nature from any modification of motion, that the term
<i>Dynamics</i>, so applied, sounds harsh and strange. For
in this science we have to treat, not only of the subterraneous forces by which parts of the earth’s crust are
shaken, elevated, or ruptured, but also of the causes
which may change the climate of a portion of the
earth’s surface, making a country hotter or colder than
in former ages; again, we have to treat of the causes
which modify the forms and habits of animals and
vegetables, and of the extent to which the effects of
such causes can proceed; whether, for instance, they
can extinguish old species and produce new. These
and other similar investigations would not be naturally
included in the notion of <i>Dynamics</i>; and therefore it <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page265">265</a></span> might perhaps be better to use the term <i>Ætiology</i>
when we wish to group together all those researches
which have it for their object to determine the laws
of such changes. In the same manner the Comparison
and History of Languages, if it is to lead to any
stable and exact knowledge, must have appended to
it an Ætiology, which aims at determining the nature
and the amount of the causes which really do produce
changes in language; as colonization, conquest, the
mixture of races, civilization, literature, and the like.
And the same rule applies to all sciences of this class.
We shall now make a few remarks on the characteristics of such branches of science as those to which
we are led by the above considerations.</p>
<p id="b10c2s4">4. <i>Phenomenology requires Classification. Phenomenal Geology.</i>&#8212;The Phenomenal portions of each science
imply Classification, for no description of a large and
varied mass of phenomena can be useful or intelligible
without classification. A representation of phenomena, in order to answer the purposes of science, must
be systematic. Accordingly, in giving the History of
Descriptive or Phenomenal Geology, I have called it
<i>Systematic Geology</i>, just as Classificatory Botany is
termed <i>Systematic Botany</i>. Moreover, as we have
already seen, Classification can never be an arbitrary
process, but always implies some natural connexion
among the objects of the same Class; for if this connexion did not exist, the Classes could not be made the
subjects of any true assertion. Yet though the classes
of phenomena which our system acknowledges must be
such as already exist in nature, the discovery of these
classes is, for the most part, very far from obvious or
easy. To detect the true principles of Natural Classes,
and to select marks by which these may be recognized,
are steps which require genius and good fortune, and
which fall to the lot only of the most eminent persons
in each science. In the History, I have pointed out
Werner, William Smith, and Cuvier, as the three
great authors of Systematic Geology of Europe. The
mode of classifying the materials of the earth’s surface which was found, by these philosophers, fitted to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page266">266</a></span> enunciate such general facts as came under their notice, was to consider the rocks and other materials as
divided into successive layers or strata, superimposed
one on another, and variously inclined and broken.
The German geologist distinguished his strata for the
most part by their mineralogical character; the other
two, by the remains of animals and plants which the
rocks contained. After a beginning had thus been
made in giving a genuine scientific form to phenomenal
geology, other steps followed in rapid succession, as has
already been related in the History<a id="fnanchor5-10" href="#note5-10"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>. The Classification of the Strata was fixed by a suitable Nomenclature. Attempts were made to apply to other countries
the order of strata which had been found to prevail in
that first studied: and in this manner it was ascertained what rocks in distant regions are the synonyms,
or <i>Equivalents</i><a id="fnanchor6-10" href="#note6-10"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>,&#8212;of each other. The knowledge thus
collected and systematized was exhibited in the form
of Geological Maps.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-10" href="#fnanchor5-10">5</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xviii. c. iii.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-10" href="#fnanchor6-10">6</a></span> <i>Ib.</i> sect. 4.</div>
<p>Moreover, among the phenomena of geology we have
Laws of Nature as well as Classes. The general form
of mountain-chains; the relations of the direction and
inclination of different chains to each other; the general features of mineral veins, faults, and fissures; the
prevalent characters of slaty cleavage;&#8212;were the subjects of laws established, or supposed to be established,
by extensive observation of facts. In like manner the
organic fossils discovered in the strata were found to
follow certain laws with reference to the climate which
they appeared to have lived in; and the evidence which
they gave of a regular zoological development. And
thus, by the assiduous labours of many accomplished
and active philosophers, Descriptive or Phenomenal
Geology was carried towards a state of completeness.</p>
<p id="b10c2s5">5. <i>Phenomenal Uranography.</i>&#8212;In like manner in
other palætiological researches, as soon as they approach to an exact and scientific form, we find the
necessity of constructing in the first place a science of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page267">267</a></span> classification and exact description, by means of which
the phenomena may be correctly represented and compared; and of obtaining by this step a solid basis for
an inquiry into the causes which have produced them.
Thus the Palætiology of the Solar System has, in recent
times, drawn the attention of speculators; and a hypothesis has been started, that our sun and his attendant
planets have been produced by the condensation of a
mass of diffused matter, such as that which constitutes
the nebulous patches which we observe in the starry
heavens. But the sagest and most enlightened astronomers have not failed to acknowledge, that to verify
or to disprove this conjecture, must be the work of
many ages of observation and thought. They have
perceived also that the first step of the labour requisite for the advancement of this portion of science
must be to obtain and to record the most exact knowledge at present within our reach, respecting the phenomena of these nebulæ, with which we thus compare
our own system; and, as a necessary element of such
knowledge, they have seen the importance of a classification of these objects, and of others, such as Double
Stars, of the same kind. Sir William Herschel, who
first perceived the bearing of the phenomena of nebulæ
upon the history of the solar system, made the observation of such objects his business, with truly admirable zeal and skill; and in the account of the results
of his labours, gave a classification of Nebulæ; separating them into, first, <i>Clusters of Stars</i>; second,
<i>Resolvable Nebulæ</i>; third, <i>Proper Nebulæ</i>; fourth,
<i>Planetary Nebulæ</i>; fifth, <i>Stellar Nebulæ</i>; sixth, <i>Nebulous Stars</i><a id="fnanchor7-10" href="#note7-10"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>. And since, in order to obtain from these
remote appearances, any probable knowledge respecting our own system, we must discover whether they
undergo any changes in the course of ages, he devoted
himself to the task of forming a record of their number and appearance in his own time, that thus the
astronomers of succeeding generations might have a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page268">268</a></span> definite and exact standard with which to compare
their observations. Still, this task would have been
executed only for that part of the heavens which is
visible in this country, if this Hipparchus of the
Nebulæ and Double Stars had not left behind him
a son who inherited all his father’s zeal and more
than his father’s knowledge. Sir John Herschel in
1833 went to the Cape of Good Hope to complete
what Sir William Herschel left wanting; and in the
course of five years observed with care all the nebulæ
and double stars of the Southern hemisphere. This
great <i>Herschelian Survey of the Heavens</i>, the completion of which is the noblest monument ever erected by
a son to a father, must necessarily be, to all ages, the
basis of all speculations concerning the history and
origin of the solar system; and has completed, so far
as at present it can be completed, the phenomenal portion of Astronomical Palætiology.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-10" href="#fnanchor7-10">7</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1786 and 1789, and Sir J. Herschel’s <i>Astronomy</i>, Art. 616.</div>
<p id="b10c2s6">6. <i>Phenomenal Geography of Plants and Animals.</i>&#8212;Again, there is another Palætiological Science,
closely connected with the speculations forced upon
the geologist by the organic fossils which he discovers
imbedded in the strata of the earth;&#8212;namely, the
Science which has for its object the Causes of the
Diffusion and Distribution of the various kinds of
Plants and Animals. And the science also has for
its first portion and indispensable foundation a description and classification of the existing phenomena.
Such portions of science have recently been cultivated
with great zeal and success, under the titles of the
<i>Geography of Plants</i>, and the <i>Geography of Animals</i>.
And the results of the inquiries thus undertaken have
assumed a definite and scientific form by leading to a
division of the earth’s surface into a certain number of
botanical and zoological <i>Provinces</i>, each province occupied by its own peculiar vegetable and animal population.
We find, too, in the course of these investigations,
various general laws of the phenomena offered to our
notice; such, for instance, as this:&#8212;that the difference
of the animals originally occupying each province,
which is clear and entire for the higher orders of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page269">269</a></span> animals and plants, becomes more doubtful and indistinct when we descend to the lower kinds of organizations; as Infusoria and Zoophytes<a id="fnanchor8-10" href="#note8-10"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a> in the animal
kingdom, Grasses and Mosses among vegetables. Again,
other laws discovered by those who have studied the
geography of plants are these:&#8212;that countries separated from each other by wide tracts of sea, as the
opposite shores of the Mediterranean, the islands of
the Indian and Pacific Oceans, have usually much that
is common in their vegetation:&#8212;and again, that in
parallel climates, analogous tribes replace each other.
It would be easy to adduce other laws, but those
already stated may serve to show the great extent of
the portions of knowledge which have just been mentioned, even considered as merely Sciences of Phenomena.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-10" href="#fnanchor8-10">8</a></span> Prichard, <i>Researches into the Physical History of Mankind</i>, i. 55, 28.</div>
<p id="b10c2s7">7. <i>Phenomenal Glossology.</i>&#8212;It is not my purpose
in the present work to borrow my leading illustrations
from any portions of knowledge but those which are
concerned with the study of material nature; and I
shall, therefore, not dwell upon a branch of research,
singularly interesting, and closely connected with the
one just mentioned, but dealing with relations of
thought rather than of things;&#8212;I mean the Palætiology of Language;&#8212;the theory, so far as the facts
enable us to form a theory, of the causes which have
led to the resemblances and differences of human speech
in various regions and various ages. This, indeed,
would be only a portion of the study of the history
and origin of the diffusion of animals, if we were to
include man among the animals whose dispersion we
thus investigate; for language is one of the most clear
and imperishable records of the early events in the
career of the human race. But the peculiar nature of
the faculty of speech, and the ideas which the use of it
involves, make it proper to treat <i>Glossology</i> as a distinct science. And of this science, the first part must
necessarily be, as in the other sciences of this order, a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page270">270</a></span> classification and comparison of languages governed in
many respects by the same rules, and presenting the
same <span class="correction" title="emended from dfficulties">difficulties</span>, as other sciences of classification.
Such, accordingly, has been the procedure of the most
philosophical glossologists. They have been led to
throw the languages of the earth into certain large
classes or <i>Families</i>, according to various kinds of resemblance; as the <i>Semitic</i> Family, to which belong
Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldean, Syrian, Phoenician, Ethiopian, and the like; the <i>Indo-European</i>, which includes
Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, and German; the
<i>Monosyllabic</i> languages, Chinese, Tibetan, Birman,
Siamese; the <i>Polysynthetic</i> languages, a class including
most of the North-American Indian dialects; and
others. And this work of classification has been the
result of the labour and study of many very profound
linguists, and has advanced gradually from step to
step. Thus the Indo-European Family was first formed
on an observation of the coincidences between Sanskrit,
Greek, and Latin; but it was soon found to include
the Teutonic languages, and more recently Dr. Prichard<a id="fnanchor9-10" href="#note9-10"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> has shown beyond doubt that the Celtic must
be included in the same Family. Other general resemblances and differences of languages have been marked
by appropriate terms: thus August von Schlegel has
denominated them <i>synthetical</i> and <i>analytical</i>, according as they form their conjugations and declensions by
auxiliary verbs and prepositions, or by changes in the
word itself: and the <i>polysynthetic</i> languages are so
named by M. Duponceau, in consequence of their still
more complex mode of inflexion. Nor are there wanting, in this science also, general laws of phenomena;
such, for instance, is the curious rule of the interchange of consonants in the cognate words of Greek,
Gothic, and German, which has been discovered by
James Grimm. All these remarkable portions of knowledge, and the great works which have appeared on
Glossology, such, for example, as the <i>Mithridates</i> of
Adelung and Vater, contain, for their largest, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page271">271</a></span> hitherto probably their most valuable part, the phenomenal portion of the science, the comparison of languages as they now are. And beyond all doubt, until
we have brought this Comparative Philology to a considerable degree of completeness, all our speculations
respecting the causes which have operated to produce
the languages of the earth must be idle and unsubstantial dreams.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-10" href="#fnanchor9-10">9</a></span> Dr Prichard, <i>On the Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations</i>. 1831.</div>
<p>Thus in all Palætiological Sciences, in all attempts to
trace back the history and discover the origin of the
present state of things, the portion of the science which
must first be formed is that which classifies the phenomena, and discovers general laws prevailing among them. When this work is performed, and not till
then, we may begin to speculate successfully concerning causes, and to make some progress in our attempts
to go back to an origin. We must have a <i>Phenomenal</i>
science preparatory to each <i>Ætiological</i> one.</p>
<p id="b10c2s8">8. <i>The Study of Phenomena leads to Theory.</i>&#8212;As
we have just said, we cannot, in any subject, speculate
successfully concerning the causes of the present state
of things, till we have obtained a tolerably complete
and systematic view of the phenomena. Yet in reality
men have not in any instance waited for this completeness and system in their knowledge of facts before
they have begun to form theories. Nor was it natural,
considering the speculative propensities of the human
mind, and how incessantly it is endeavouring to apply
the Idea of Cause, that it should thus restrain itself.
I have already noticed this in the History of Geology.
‘While we have been giving an account,’ it is there
said, ‘of the objects with which Descriptive Geology is
occupied, it must have been felt how difficult it is, in
contemplating such facts, to confine ourselves to description and classification. Conjectures and reasonings respecting the causes of the phenomena force
themselves upon us at every step; and even influence our classification and nomenclature. Our Descriptive Geology impels us to construct a Physical
Geology.’ And the same is the case with regard to
the other subjects which I have mentioned. The mere <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page272">272</a></span> consideration of the different degrees of condensation of
different Nebulæ led Herschel and Laplace to contemplate the hypothesis that our solar system is a condensed Nebula. Immediately upon the division of the
earth’s surface into botanical and zoological provinces,
and even at an earlier period, the opposite hypotheses
of the Origin of all the animals of each kind from a
single pair, and of their original diffusion all over the
earth, were under discussion. And the consideration
of the families of languages irresistibly led to speculations concerning the Families of the earliest human
inhabitants of the earth. In all cases the contemplation of a very few phenomena, the discovery of a very
few steps in the history, made men wish for and attempt to form a theory of the history from the very
beginning of things.</p>
<p id="b10c2s9">9. <i>No sound Theory without Ætiology.</i>&#8212;But though
man is thus impelled by the natural propensities of his
intellect to trace each order of things to its causes, he
does not at first discern the only sure way of obtaining
such knowledge: he does not suspect how much labour
and how much method are requisite for success in this
undertaking: he is not aware that for each order of
phenomena he must construct, by the accumulated results of multiplied observation and distinct thought, a
separate Æiology. Thus, as I have elsewhere remarked<a id="fnanchor10-10" href="#note10-10"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a>, when men had for the first time become
acquainted with some of the leading phenomena of
Geology, and had proceeded to speculate concerning
the past changes and revolutions by which such results
had been produced, they forthwith supposed themselves
able to judge what would be the effects of any of the
obvious agents of change, as Water or Volcanic Fire. It
did not at first occur to them to suspect that their
common and extemporaneous judgment on such points
was by no means sufficient for sound knowledge. They
did not foresee that, before they could determine what
share these or any other causes had had in producing
the present condition of the earth, they must create <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page273">273</a></span> a special science whose object should be to estimate
the general laws and effects of such assumed causes;&#8212;that before they could obtain any sound Geological Theory, they must carefully cultivate Geological
Ætiology.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-10" href="#fnanchor10-10">10</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xviii. c. v. sect. 1.</div>
<p>The same disposition to proceed immediately from
the facts to the theory, without constructing, as an intermediate step, a Science of Causes, might be pointed
out in the other sciences of this order. But in all of
them this errour has been corrected by the failures to
which it led. It soon appeared, for instance, that a
more careful inquiry into the effects which climate,
food, habit and circumstances can produce in animals,
was requisite in order to determine how the diversities
of animals in different countries have originated. The
Ætiology of Animal Life (if we may be allowed to
give this name to that study of such causes of change
which is at present so zealously cultivated, and which
yet has no distinctive designation, except so far as it
coincides with the <i>Organic Geological Dynamics</i> of our
History) is now perceived to be a necessary portion of
all attempts to construct a history of the earth and its
inhabitants.</p>
<p id="b10c2s10">10. <i>Cause, in Palætiology.</i>&#8212;We are thus led to
contemplate a class of Sciences which are commenced
with the study of Causes. We have already considered sciences which depended mainly upon the Idea of
Cause, namely, the Mechanical Sciences. But it is
obvious that the Idea of Cause in the researches now
under our consideration must be employed in a very
different way from that in which we applied it formerly. Force is the <em>Cause</em> of motion, because force
at all times and under all circumstances, if not counteracted, produces motion; but the Cause of the present
condition and elevation of the Alps, whatever it was,
was manifested in a series of events of which each happened but once, and occupied its proper place in the
series of time. The former is <em>mechanical</em>, the latter
<em>historical</em>, <em>cause</em>. In our present investigations, we
consider the events which we contemplate, of whatever
order they be, as forming a chain which is extended <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page274">274</a></span> from the beginning of things down to the present time;
and the causes of which we now speak are those which
connect the successive links of this chain. Every occurrence which has taken place in the history of the
solar system, or the earth, or its vegetable and animal
creation, or man, has been at the same time effect and
cause;&#8212;the effect of what preceded, the cause of what
succeeded. By being effect and cause, it has occupied
some certain portion of time; and the times which
have thus been occupied by effects and causes, summed up and taken altogether, make up the total of
Past Time. The Past has been a series of events connected by this historical causation, and the Present is
the last term of this series. The problem in the Palætiological Sciences, with which we are here concerned,
is, to determine the manner in which each term is derived from the preceding, and thus, if possible, to calculate backwards to the origin of the series.</p>
<p id="b10c2s11">11. <i>Various kinds of Cause.</i>&#8212;Those modes by
which one term in the natural series of events is
derived from another,&#8212;the forms of historical causation,&#8212;the kinds of connexion between the links of
the infinite chain of time,&#8212;are very various; nor need
we attempt to enumerate them. But these kinds of
causation being distinguished from each other, and
separately studied, each becomes the subject of a
separate Ætiology. Thus the causes of change in the
earth’s surface, residing in the elements, fire and water,
form the main subject of Geological Ætiology. The
Ætiology of the vegetable and animal kingdoms investigates the causes by which the forms and distribution
of species of plants and animals are affected. The
study of causes in Glossology leads to an Ætiology of
Language, which shall distinguish, analyse, and estimate the causes by which certain changes are produced
in the languages of nations; in like manner we may
expect to have an Ætiology of Art, which shall
scrutinise the influences by which the various forms of
art have each given birth to its successor: by which,
for example, there have been brought into being those
various forms of architecture which we term Egyptian, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page275">275</a></span> Doric, Ionic, Roman, Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic,
Italian, Elizabethan. It is easily seen by this slight
survey how manifold and diverse are the kinds of
cause which the Palætiological Sciences bring under
our consideration. But in each of those sciences we
shall obtain solid and complete systems of knowledge,
only so far as we study, with steady thought and
careful observation, that peculiar kind of cause which
is appropriate to the phenomena under our consideration.</p>
<p id="b10c2s12">12. <i>Hypothetical Order of Palætiological Causes.</i>&#8212;The various kinds of historical cause are not only connected with each other by their common bearing upon
the historical sciences, but they form a kind of progression which we may represent to ourselves as having
acted in succession in the hypothetical history of the
earth and its inhabitants. Thus assuming, merely as a
momentary hypothesis, the origin of the Solar System
by the condensation of a Nebula, we have to contemplate, first, the causes by which the luminous incandescent diffused mass of which a nebula is supposed
to be constituted, is gradually condensed, cooled,
collected into definite masses, solidified, and each
portion made to revolve about its axis, and the
whole to travel about another body. We have no
difficulty in ascribing the globular form of each mass
to the mutual attraction of its particles: but when
this form was once assumed, and covered with a solid
crust, are there, we may ask, in the constitution of
such a body, any causes at work by which the crust
might be again broken up and portions of it displaced,
and covered with other matter? Again, if we can thus
explain the origin of the Earth, can we with like success account for the presence of the Atmosphere and
the Waters of earth and ocean? Supposing this done,
we have then to consider by what causes such a body
could become stocked with vegetable and animal Life;
for there have not been wanting persons, extravagant
speculators, no doubt, who have conceived that even this
event in the history of the world might be the work
of natural causes. Supposing an origin given to life <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page276">276</a></span> upon our earth, we have then, brought before us by
geological observations, a series of different forms of
vegetable and animal existence; occurring in different
strata, and, as the phenomena appear irresistibly to
prove, existing at successive periods: and we are compelled to inquire what can have been the causes by
which the forms of each period have passed into those
of the next. We find, too, that strata, which must
have been at first horizontal and continuous, have
undergone enormous dislocations and ruptures, and we
have to consider the possible effect of aqueous and
volcanic causes to produce such changes in the earth’s
crust. We are thus led to the causes which have
produced the present state of things on the earth; and
these are causes to which we may hypothetically
ascribe, not only the form and position of the inert
materials of the earth, but also the nature and distribution of its animal and vegetable population. Man
too, no less than other animals, is affected by the
operation of such causes as we have referred to, and
must, therefore, be included in such speculations. But
man’s history only begins, where that of other animals
ends, with his mere existence. They are stationary,
he is progressive. Other species of animals, once
brought into being, continue the same through all
ages; man is changing, from age to age, his language,
his thoughts, his works. Yet even these changes are
bound together by laws of causation; and these causes
too may become objects of scientific study. And such
causes, though not to be dwelt upon now, since we
permit ourselves to found our philosophy upon the
material sciences only, must still, when treated scientifically, fall within the principles of our philosophy,
and must be governed by the same general rules to
which all science is subject. And thus we are led by
a close and natural connexion, through a series of
causes, extending from those which regulate the imperceptible changes of the remotest nebulæ in the heavens,
to those which determine the diversities of language,
the mutations of art, and even the progress of civilization, polity, and literature. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page277">277</a></span></p>
<p>While I have been speaking of this supposed series
of events, including in its course the formation of the
earth, the introduction of animal and vegetable life,
and the revolutions by which one collection of species
has succeeded another, it must not be forgotten, that
though I have thus hypothetically spoken of these
events as occurring by force of natural causes, this has
been done only that the true efficacy of such causes
might be brought under our consideration and made
the subject of scientific examination. It may be found,
that such occurrences as these are quite inexplicable
by the aid of any natural causes with which we are
acquainted; and thus, the result of our investigations,
conducted with strict regard to scientific principles,
may be, that we must either contemplate supernatural
influences as part of the past series of events, or declare
ourselves altogether unable to form this series into a
connected chain.</p>
<p id="b10c2s13">13. <i>Mode of Cultivating Ætiology:&#8212;In Geology.</i>&#8212;In what manner, it may be asked, is Ætiology, with
regard to each subject such as we have enumerated, to
be cultivated? In order to answer this question, we
must, according to our method of proceeding, take the
most successful and complete examples which we possess of such portions of science. But in truth, we can
as yet refer to few examples of this kind. In Geology, it is only very recently, and principally through
the example and influence of Sir Charles Lyell, that
the Ætiology has been detached from the descriptive
portion of the science; and cultivated with direct
attention: in other sciences the separation has hardly
yet been made. But if we examine what has already
been done in Geological Ætiology, or as in the History
it is termed, <i>Geological Dynamics</i>, we shall find a
number of different kinds of investigation which,
by the aid of our general principles respecting the formation of sciences, may suffice to supply very useful
suggestions for Ætiology in general.</p>
<p>In Geological Ætiology, causes have been studied, in
many instances, by attending to their action in the phenomena of the present state of things, and by inferring <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page278">278</a></span> from this the nature and extent of the action which
they may have exercised in former times. This has
been done, for example, by Von Hoff, Sir Charles Lyell,
and others, with regard to the operations of rivers, seas,
springs, glaciers, and other aqueous causes of change,
Again, the same course has been followed by the same
philosophers with respect to volcanoes, earthquakes, and
other violent agents. Sir Charles Lyell has attempted
to show, too, that there take place, in our own time,
not only violent agitations, but slow motions of parts
of the earth’s crust, of the same kind and order with
those which have assisted in producing all anterior
changes.</p>
<p>But while we thus seek instruction in the phenomena of the present state of things, we are led to the
question, What are the limits of this ‘present’ period?
For instance, among the currents of lava which we
trace as part of the shores of Italy and Sicily, <em>which</em>
shall we select as belonging to the existing order of
things? In going backwards in time, where shall we
draw the line? and why at such particular point?
These questions are important, for our estimate of the
efficacy of known causes will vary with the extent of
the effects which we ascribe to them. Hence the mode
in which we group together rocks is not only a step in
geological classification, but is also important to Ætiology. Thus, when the vast masses of trap rocks in the
Western Isles of Scotland and in other countries, which
had been maintained by the Wernerians to be of aqueous origin, were, principally by the sagacity and industry of Macculloch, identified as to their nature with
the products of recent volcanoes, the amount of effect
which might justifiably be ascribed to volcanic agency
was materially extended.</p>
<p>In other cases, instead of observing the current
effects of our geological causes, we have to estimate the
results from what we know of the causes themselves;
as when, with Herschel, we calculate the alterations
in the temperature of the earth which astronomical
changes may possibly produce; or when, with Fourier,
we try to calculate the rate of cooling of the earth’s <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page279">279</a></span> surface, on the hypothesis of an incandescent central
mass. In other cases, again, we are not able to calculate the effects of our causes rigorously, but estimate
them as well as we can; partly by physical reasonings,
and partly by comparison with such analogous cases as
we can find in the present state of things. Thus Sir
Charles Lyell infers the change of climate which would
result if land were transferred from the neighbourhood
of the poles to that of the equator, by reasonings on the
power of land and water to contain and communicate
heat, supported by a reference to the different actual
climates of places, lying under the same latitude, but
under different conditions as to the distribution of
land and water.</p>
<p>Thus our Ætiology is constructed partly from calculation and reasoning, partly from phenomena. But we
may observe that when we reason from phenomena to
causes, we usually do so by various steps; often ascending from phenomena to mere laws of phenomena, before
we can venture to connect the phenomenon confidently
with its cause. Thus the law of subterranean heat,
that it increases in descending below the surface, is
now well established, although the doctrine which
ascribes this effect to a central heat is not universally
assented to.</p>
<p id="b10c2s14">14. <i>In the Geography of Plants and Animals.</i>&#8212;We may find in other subjects also, considerable contributions towards Ætiology, though not as yet a complete System of Science. The Ætiology of Vegetables
and Animals, indeed, has been studied with great zeal
in modern times, as an essential preparative to geological theory; for how can we decide whether any
assumed causes have produced the succession of species
which we find in the earth’s strata, except we know
what effect of this kind given causes can produce?
Accordingly, we find in Sir Charles Lyell’s <i>Treatise on
Geology</i> the most complete discussion of such questions
as belong to these subjects:&#8212;for example, the question
whether species can be transmuted into other species
by the long-continued influence of external causes, as
climate, food, domestication, combined with internal <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page280">280</a></span> causes, as habits, appetencies, progressive tendencies.
We may observe, too, that as we have brought before
us, the inquiry what change difference of climate can
produce in any species, we have also the inverse problem, how far a different development of the species, or
a different collection of species, proves a difference of
climate. In the same way, the geologist of the present
day considers the question, whether, in virtue of causes
now in action, species are from time to time extinguished; and in like manner, the geologists of an
earlier period discussed the question, now long completely decided, whether fossil species in general are
really extinct species.</p>
<p id="b10c2s15">15. <i>In Languages.</i>&#8212;Even with reference to the
Ætiology of Language, although this branch of science
has hardly been considered separately from the glossological investigations in which it is employed or assumed to be employed, it might perhaps be possible
to point out causes or conditions of change which,
being general in their nature, must operate upon all
languages alike. Changes made for the sake of euphony
when words are modified and combined, occur in all
dialects. Who can doubt that such changes of consonants as those by which the Greek roots become Gothic,
and the Gothic, German, have for their cause some
general principle in the pronunciation of each language? Again, we might attempt to decide other
questions of no small interest. Have the terminations
of verbs arisen from the accretion of pronouns; or, on
the other hand, does the modification of a verb imply
a simpler mental process than the insulation of a pronoun, as Adam Smith has maintained? Again, when
the language of a nation is changed by the invasion
and permanent mixture of an enemy of different speech,
is it generally true that it is changed from a synthetic
to an analytical structure? I will mention only one
more of these wide and general glossological inquiries.
Is it true, as Dr. Prichard has suggested<a id="fnanchor11-10" href="#note11-10"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a>, that languages have become more permanent as we come down <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page281">281</a></span> towards later times? May we justifiably suppose, with
him, that in the very earliest times, nations, when
they had separated from one stock, might lose all
traces of this common origin out of their languages,
though retaining strong evidences of it in their mythology, social forms, and arts, as appears to be the case
with the ancient Egyptians and the Indians<a id="fnanchor12-10" href="#note12-10"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-10" href="#fnanchor11-10">11</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, ii. 221.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-10" href="#fnanchor12-10">12</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, ii. 192.</div>
<p>Large questions of this nature cannot be treated
profitably in any other way than by an assiduous study
of the most varied forms of living and dead languages.
But on the other hand, the study of languages should
be prosecuted not only by a direct comparison of one
with another, but also with a view to the formation
of a science of causes and general principles, embracing
such discussions as I have pointed out. It is only
when such a science has been formed, that we can hope
to obtain any solid and certain results in the Palætiology of Language;&#8212;to determine, with any degree of
substantial proof, what is the real evidence which the
wonderful faculty of speech, under its present developments and forms, bears to the events which have taken
place in its own history, and in the history of man
since his first origin.</p>
<p id="b10c2s16">16. <i>Construction of Theories.</i>&#8212;When we have thus
obtained, with reference to any such subject as those
we have here spoken of, these two portions of science,
a Systematic Description of the Facts, and a rigorous
Analysis of the Causes,&#8212;the <i>Phenomenology</i> and the
<i>Ætiology</i> of the subject,&#8212;we are prepared for the third
member which completes the science, the <i>Theory</i> of the
actual facts. We can then take a view of the events
which really have happened, discerning their connexion, interpreting their evidence, supplying from
the context the parts which are unapparent. We
can account for known facts by intelligible causes;
we can infer latent facts from manifest effects, so as
to obtain a distinct insight into the whole history of
events up to the present time, and to see the last result of the whole in the present condition of things. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page282">282</a></span> The term <i>Theory</i>, when rigorously employed in such
sciences as those which we here consider, bears nearly
the sense which I have adopted: it implies a consistent
and systematic view of the actual facts, combined with
a true apprehension of their connexion and causes.
Thus if we speak of ‘a Theory of Mount Etna,’ or
‘a Theory of the Paris Basin,’ we mean a connected
and intelligible view of the events by which the rocks
in these localities have come into their present condition. Undoubtedly the term <i>Theory</i> has often been
used in a looser sense; and men have put forth ‘<i>Theories of the Earth</i>,’ which, instead of including the whole
mass of actual geological facts and their causes, only
assigned, in a vague manner, some causes by which
some few phenomena might, it was conceived, be accounted for. Perhaps the portion of our Palætiological
Sciences which we now wish to designate, would be
more generally understood if we were to describe it as
<i>Theoretical</i> or <i>Philosophical History</i>; as when we talk
of ‘the Theoretical History of Architecture,’ or ‘the
Philosophical History of Language.’ And in the same
manner we might speak of the Theoretical History of
the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms; meaning, a distinct account of the events which have produced the
present distribution of species and families. But by
whatever phrase we describe this portion of science, it
is plain that such a Theory, such a Theoretical History, must result from the application of causes well
understood to facts well ascertained. And if the term
<i>Theory</i> be here employed, we must recollect that it is
to be understood, not in its narrower sense as opposed
to facts, but in its wider signification, as including all
known facts and differing from them only in introducing among them principles of intelligible connexion.
The Theories of which we now speak are true <i>Theories</i>,
precisely because they are identical with the total system of the <i>Facts</i>.</p>
<p id="b10c2s17">17. <i>No sound Palætiological Theory yet extant.</i>&#8212;It is not to disparage unjustly the present state of
science, to say that as yet no such theory exists on
any subject. ‘Theories of the Earth’ have been <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page283">283</a></span> repeatedly published; but when we consider that even
the facts of geology have been observed only on a small
portion of the earth’s surface, and even within those
narrow bounds very imperfectly studied, we shall be
able to judge how impossible it is that geologists should
have yet obtained a well-established Theoretical History of the changes which have taken place in the
crust of the terrestrial globe from its first origin. Accordingly, I have ventured in my History to designate
the most prominent of the Theories which have hitherto prevailed as <em>premature</em> geological theories<a id="fnanchor13-10" href="#note13-10"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a>: and we
shall soon see that geological theory has not advanced
beyond a few conjectures, and that its cultivators are
at present mainly occupied with a controversy in which
the two extreme hypotheses which first offer themselves
to men’s minds are opposed to each other. And if we
have no theoretical History of the Earth which merits
any confidence, still less have we any theoretical History of Language, or of the Arts, which we can consider as satisfactory. The Theoretical History of the
Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms is closely connected
with that of the Earth on which they subsist, and must
follow the fortunes of Geology. And thus we may
venture to say that no Palætiological Science, as yet,
possesses all its three members. Indeed most of them
are very far from having completed and systematized
their Phenomenology: in all, the cultivation of Ætiology is but just begun, or is not begun; in all, the
Theory must reward the exertions of future, probably
of distant, generations.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page284"></a></span>
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Doctrine of Catastrophes and the Doctrine of Uniformity.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b10c3s1">1. <i>Doctrine of Catastrophes.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">I have</span> already shown,
in the History of Geology, that the attempts to frame
a theory of the earth have brought into view two completely opposite opinions:&#8212;one, which represents the
course of nature as <em>uniform</em> through all ages, the
causes which produce change having had the same
intensity in former times which they have at the present day;&#8212;the other opinion, which sees, in the present condition of things, evidences of <em>catastrophes</em>;&#8212;changes of a more sweeping kind, and produced by
more powerful agencies than those which occur in recent times. Geologists who held the latter opinion,
maintained that the forces which have elevated the
Alps or the Andes to their present height could not
have been any forces which are now in action: they
pointed to vast masses of strata hundreds of miles long,
thousands of feet thick, thrown into highly-inclined
positions, fractured, dislocated, crushed: they remarked
that upon the shattered edges of such strata they found
enormous accumulations of fragments and rubbish,
rounded by the action of water, so as to denote ages
of violent aqueous action: they conceived that they
saw instances in which whole mountains of rock in a
state of igneous fusion, must have burst the earth’s crust
from below: they found that in the course of the revolutions by which one stratum of rock was placed
upon another, the whole collection of animal species
which tenanted the earth and the seas had been removed, and a new set of living things introduced in
its place: finally, they found, above all the strata, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page285">285</a></span> vast masses of sand and gravel containing bones of
animals, and apparently the work of a mighty deluge.
With all these proofs before their eyes, they thought
it impossible not to judge that the agents of change by
which the world was urged from one condition to
another till it reached its present state must have been
more violent, more powerful, than any which we see at
work around us. They conceived that the evidence of
‘catastrophes’ was irresistible.</p>
<p id="b10c3s2">2. <i>Doctrine of Uniformity.</i>&#8212;I need not here repeat the narrative (given in the History<a id="fnanchor14-10" href="#note14-10"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>) of the
process by which this formidable array of proofs was,
in the minds of some eminent geologists, weakened,
and at last overcome. This was done by showing that
the sudden breaks in the succession of strata were
apparent only, the discontinuity of the series which
occurred in one country being removed by terms
interposed in another locality:&#8212;by urging that the
total effect produced by existing causes, taking into
account the accumulated result of long periods, is far
greater than a casual speculator would think possible:&#8212;by making it appear that there are in many parts of
the world evidences of a slow and imperceptible rising
of the land since it was the habitation of now existing species:&#8212;by proving that it is not universally
true that the strata separated in time by supposed
catastrophes contain distinct species of animals:&#8212;by
pointing out the limited fields of the supposed diluvial
action:&#8212;and finally, by remarking that though the
<em>creation</em> of species is a mystery, the <em>extinction</em> of
species is going on in our own day. Hypotheses were
suggested, too, by which it was conceived that the
change of climate might be explained, which, as the
consideration of the fossil remains seemed to show,
must have taken place between the ancient and the
modern times. In this manner the whole evidence of
catastrophes was explained away: the notion of a
series of paroxysms of violence in the causes of change
was represented as a delusion arising from our <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page286">286</a></span> contemplating short periods only, in the action of present
causes: length of time was called in to take the place
of intensity of force: and it was declared that Geology
need not despair of accounting for the revolutions of
the earth, as Astronomy accounts for the revolutions
of the heavens, by the universal action of causes
which are close at hand to us, operating through time
and space without variation or decay.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-10" href="#fnanchor14-10">14</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xviii. c. viii. sect. 2.</div>
<p>An antagonism of opinions, somewhat of the same
kind as this, will be found to manifest itself in the
other Palætiological Sciences as well as in Geology;
and it will be instructive to endeavour to balance these
opposite doctrines. I will mention some of the considerations which bear upon the subject in its general
form.</p>
<p id="b10c3s3">3. <i>Is Uniformity probable à priori?</i>&#8212;The doctrine
of Uniformity in the course of nature has sometimes
been represented by its adherents as possessing a great
degree of <i>à priori</i> probability. It is highly unphilosophical, it has been urged, to assume that the causes of
the geological events of former times were of a different
kind from causes now in action, if causes of this latter
kind can in any way be made to explain the facts.
The analogy of all other sciences compels us, it was
said, to explain phenomena by known, not by unknown,
causes. And on these grounds the geological teacher
recommended<a id="fnanchor15-10" href="#note15-10"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> ‘an earnest and patient endeavour to
reconcile the indications of former change with the
evidence of gradual mutations now in progress.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-10" href="#fnanchor15-10">15</a></span> Lyell, 4th ed. b. iv. c. i. p. 328.</div>
<p>But on this we may remark, that if by <em>known</em>
causes we mean causes acting with the same intensity
which they have had during historical times, the restriction is altogether arbitrary and groundless. Let
it be granted, for instance, that many parts of the
earth’s surface are now undergoing an imperceptible
rise. It is not pretended that the rate of this elevation is rigorously uniform; what, then, are the limits
of its velocity? Why may it not increase so as to assume that character of violence which we may term a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page287">287</a></span> <i>catastrophe</i> with reference to all changes hitherto recorded? Why may not the rate of elevation be such
that we may conceive the strata to assume <em>suddenly</em>
a position nearly vertical? And is it, in fact, easy to
conceive a position of strata nearly vertical, a position
which occurs so frequently, to be <em>gradually</em> assumed?
In cases where the strata are nearly vertical, as in the
Isle of Wight, and hundreds of other places, or where
they are actually inverted, as sometimes occurs, are not
the causes which have produced the effect as truly
known causes, as those which have raised the coasts
where we trace the former beach in an elevated
terrace? If the latter case proves <em>slow</em> elevation, does
not the former case prove <em>rapid</em> elevation? In neither
case have we any measure of the time employed in the
change; but does not the very nature of the results
enable us to discern, that if one was gradual, the other
was comparatively sudden?</p>
<p>The causes which are now elevating a portion of
Scandinavia can be called known <i>causes</i>, only because
we know the <em>effect</em>. Are not the causes which have
elevated the Alps and the Andes known causes in the
same sense? We know nothing in either case which
confines the intensity of the force within any limit, or
prescribes to it any law of uniformity. Why, then,
should we make a merit of cramping our speculations
by such assumptions? Whether the causes of change
do act uniformly;&#8212;whether they oscillate only within
narrow limits;&#8212;whether their intensity in former
times was nearly the same as it now is;&#8212;these are
precisely the questions which we wish Science to answer to us impartially and truly: where is then the
wisdom of ‘an earnest and patient endeavour’ to secure
an <em>affirmative</em> reply?</p>
<p>Thus I conceive that the assertion of an <i>à priori</i>
claim to probability and philosophical spirit in favour
of the doctrine of uniformity, is quite untenable. We
must learn from an examination of all the facts, and
not from any assumption of our own, whether the
course of nature be uniform. The limit of intensity
being really unknown, catastrophes are just as probable <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page288">288</a></span> as uniformity. If a volcano may repose for a thousand
years, and then break out and destroy a city; why
may not another volcano repose for ten thousand
years, and then destroy a continent; or if a continent,
why not the whole habitable surface of the earth?</p>
<p id="b10c3s4">4. <i>Cycle of Uniformity indefinite.</i>&#8212;But this argument may be put in another form. When it is said
that the course of nature is uniform, the assertion is
not intended to exclude certain smaller variations of
violence and rest, such as we have just spoken of;&#8212;alternations of activity and repose in volcanoes; or
earthquakes, deluges, and storms, interposed in a more
tranquil state of things. With regard to such occurrences, terrible as they appear at the time, they may
not much affect the average rate of change; there may
be a <em>cycle</em>, though an irregular one, of rapid and slow
change; and if such cycles go on succeeding each other,
we may still call the order of nature uniform, notwithstanding the periods of violence which it involves.
The maximum and minimum intensities of the forces
of mutation alternate with one another; and we may
estimate the average course of nature as that which
corresponds to something between the two extremes.</p>
<p>But if we thus attempt to maintain the uniformity
of nature by representing it as a series of <i>cycles</i>,
we find that we cannot discover, in this conception,
any solid ground for excluding catastrophes. What is
the length of that cycle, the repetition of which constitutes uniformity? What interval from the maximum
to the minimum does it admit of? We may take for
our cycle a hundred or a thousand years, but evidently
such a proceeding is altogether arbitrary. We may
mark our cycles by the greatest known paroxysms of
volcanic and terremotive agency, but this procedure is
no less indefinite and inconclusive than the other.</p>
<p>But further; since the cycle in which violence and
repose alternate is thus indefinite in its length and in
its range of activity, what ground have we for assuming more than one such cycle, extending from the
origin of things to the present time? Why may we
not suppose the maximum force of the causes of change <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page289">289</a></span> to have taken place at the earliest period, and the tendency towards the minimum to have gone on ever
since? Or instead of only one cycle, there may have
been several, but of such length that our historical
period forms a portion only of the last;&#8212;the feeblest
portion of the latest cycle. And thus violence and
repose may alternate upon a scale of time and intensity
so large, that man’s experience supplies no evidence
enabling him to estimate the amount. The course of
things is <em>uniform</em>, to an Intelligence which can embrace
the succession of several cycles, but it is <em>catastrophic</em>
to the contemplation of man, whose survey can grasp a
part only of one cycle. And thus the hypothesis of
uniformity, since it cannot exclude degrees of change,
nor limit the range of these degrees, nor define the
interval of their recurrence, cannot possess any essential simplicity which, previous to inquiry, gives it a
claim upon our assent superior to that of the opposite
catastrophic hypothesis.</p>
<p id="b10c3s5">5. <i>Uniformitarian Arguments are Negative only.</i>&#8212;There is an opposite tendency in the mode of maintaining the catastrophist and the uniformitarian opinions, which depends upon their fundamental principles, and shows itself in all the controversies between
them. The Catastrophist is affirmative, the Uniformitarian is negative in his assertions: the former is constantly attempting to construct a theory; the latter
delights in demolishing all theories. The one is constantly bringing fresh evidence of some great past
event, or series of events, of a striking and definite
kind; his antagonist is at every step explaining away
the evidence, and showing that it proves nothing. One
geologist adduces his proofs of a vast universal deluge;
but another endeavours to show that the proofs do
not establish either the universality or the vastness of
such an event. The inclined broken edges of a certain
formation, covered with their own fragments, beneath
superjacent horizontal deposits, are at one time supposed to prove a catastrophic breaking up of the earlier
strata; but this opinion is controverted by showing that
the same formations, when pursued into other countries, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page290">290</a></span> exhibit a uniform gradation from the lower to the
upper, with no trace of violence. Extensive and lofty
elevations of the coast, continents of igneous rock, at
first appear to indicate operations far more gigantic
than those which now occur; but attempts are soon
made to show that time only is wanting to enable the
present age to rival the past in the production of such
changes. Each new fact adduced by the catastrophist
is at first striking and apparently convincing; but as it
becomes familiar, it strikes the imagination less powerfully; and the uniformitarian, constantly labouring to
produce some imitation of it by the machinery which
he has so well studied, at last in every case seems to
himself to succeed, so far as to destroy the effect of his
opponent’s evidence.</p>
<p>This is so with regard to more remote, as well as
with regard to immediate evidences of change. When
it is ascertained that in every part of the earth’s crust
the temperature increases as we descend below the
surface, at first this fact seems to indicate a central
heat: and a central heat naturally suggests an earlier
state of the mass, in which it was incandescent, and
from which it is now cooling. But this original incandescence of the globe of the earth is manifestly an
entire violation of the present course of things; it
belongs to the catastrophist view, and the advocates
of uniformity have to explain it away. Accordingly,
one of them holds that this increase of heat in descending below the surface may very possibly not go on all
the way to the center. The heat which increases at
first as we descend, may, he conceives, afterwards
decrease; and he suggests causes which may have produced such a succession of hotter and colder shells
within the mass of the earth. I have mentioned this
suggestion in the History of Geology; and have given
my reasons for believing it altogether untenable<a id="fnanchor16-10" href="#note16-10"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a>.
Other persons also, desirous of reconciling this subterraneous heat with the tenet of uniformity, have <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page291">291</a></span> offered another suggestion:&#8212;that the warmth or incandescence of the interior parts of the earth does not
arise out of an originally hot condition from which it
is gradually cooling, but results from chemical action
constantly going on among the materials of the earth’s
substance. And thus new attempts are perpetually
making, to escape from the cogency of the reasonings
which send us towards an original state of things different from the present. Those who theorize concerning an origin go on building up the fabric of their
speculations, while those who think such theories unphilosophical, ever and anon dig away the foundation
of this structure. As we have already said, the uniformitarian’s doctrines are a collection of negatives.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-10" href="#fnanchor16-10">16</a></span> <i>Hist. Ind. Sc.</i> b. xviii. c. v. sect. 5, and note.</div>
<p>This is so entirely the case, that the uniformitarian
would for the most part shrink from maintaining as
positive tenets the explanations which he so willingly
uses as instruments of controversy. He puts forward
his suggestions as difficulties, but he will not stand by
them as doctrines. And this is in accordance with his
general tendency; for any of his hypotheses, if insisted
upon as positive theories, would be found inconsistent
with the assertion of uniformity. For example, the
nebular hypothesis appears to give to the history of
the heavens an aspect which obliterates all special acts
of creation, for, according to that hypothesis, new
planetary systems are constantly forming; but when
asserted as the origin of our own solar system, it
brings with it an original incandescence, and an origin
of the organic world. And if, instead of using the
chemical theory of subterraneous heat to neutralize the
evidence of original incandescence, we assert it as a
positive tenet, we can no longer maintain the infinite
past duration of the earth; for chemical forces, as well
as mechanical, tend to equilibrium; and that condition
once attained, their efficacy ceases. Chemical affinities
tend to form new compounds; and though, when many
and various elements are mingled together, the play of
synthesis and analysis may go on for a long time, it
must at last end. If, for instance, a large portion of
the earth’s mass were originally pure potassium, we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page292">292</a></span> can imagine violent igneous action to go on so long as
any part remained unoxidized; but when the oxidation of the whole has once taken place, this action
must be at an end; for there is in the hypothesis
no agency which can reproduce the deoxidized metal.
Thus a perpetual motion is impossible in chemistry, as
it is in mechanics; and a theory of constant change
continued through infinite time, is untenable when
asserted upon chemical, no less than upon mechanical
principles. And thus the Skepticism of the uniformitarian is of force only so long as it is employed
against the Dogmatism of the catastrophist. When
the Doubts are erected into Dogmas, they are no
longer consistent with the tenet of Uniformity. When
the Negations become Affirmations, the Negation of an
Origin vanishes also.</p>
<p id="b10c3s6">6. <i>Uniformity in the Organic World.</i>&#8212;In speaking
of the violent and sudden changes which constitute
catastrophes, our thoughts naturally turn at first to
great <em>mechanical</em> and <em>physical</em> effects;&#8212;ruptures and
displacements of strata; extensive submersions and
emersions of land; rapid changes of temperature. But
the catastrophes which we have to consider in geology
affect the <em>organic</em> as well as the inorganic world. The
sudden extinction of one collection of species, and the
introduction of another in their place, is a Catastrophe,
even if unaccompanied by mechanical violence. Accordingly, the antagonism of the catastrophist and
uniformitarian schools has shown itself in this department of the subject, as well as in the other. When
geologists had first discovered that the successive strata
are each distinguished by appropriate organic fossils,
they assumed at once that each of these collections of
living things belonged to a separate creation. But
this conclusion, as I have already said, Sir C. Lyell has
attempted to invalidate, by proving that in the existing order of things, some species become extinct; and
by suggesting it as possible, that in the same order, it
may be true that new species are from time to time
produced, even in the present course of nature. And
in this, as in the other part of the subject, he calls in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page293">293</a></span> the aid of vast periods of time, in order that the violence of the changes may be softened down: and he
appears disposed to believe that the actual extinction
and creation of species may be so slow as to excite no
more notice than it has hitherto obtained; and yet may
be rapid enough, considering the immensity of geological periods, to produce such a succession of different
collections of species as we find in the strata of the
earth’s surface.</p>
<p id="b10c3s7">7. <i>Origin of the present Organic World.</i>&#8212;The last
great event in the history of the vegetable and animal
kingdoms was that by which their various tribes were
placed in their present seats. And we may form
various hypotheses with regard to the sudden or gradual manner in which we may suppose this distribution
to have taken place. We may assume that at the beginning of the present order of things, a stock of each
species was placed in the vegetable or animal <i>province</i>
to which it belongs, by some cause out of the common order of nature; or we may take a uniformitarian view of the subject, and suppose that the provinces of the organic world derived their population
from some anterior state of things by the operation of
natural causes.</p>
<p>Nothing has been pointed out in the existing order
of things which has any analogy or resemblance, of
any valid kind, to that creative energy which must be
exerted in the production of a new species. And to
assume the introduction of new species as ‘a part of
the order of nature,’ without pointing out any natural
fact with which such an event can be classed, would
be to reject creation by an arbitrary act. Hence,
even on natural grounds, the most intelligible view of
the history of the animal and vegetable kingdoms
seems to be, that each period which is marked by a
distinct collection of species forms a cycle; and that at
the beginning of each such cycle a creative power was
exerted, of a kind to which there was nothing at all
analogous in the succeeding part of the same cycle. If
it be urged that in some cases the same species, or the
same genus, runs through two geological formations, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page294">294</a></span> which must, on other grounds, be referred to different
cycles of creative energy, we may reply that the creation of many new species does not imply the extinction
of all the old ones.</p>
<p>Thus we are led by our reasonings to this view, that
the present order of things was commenced by an act
of creative power entirely different to any agency which
has been exerted since. None of the influences which
have modified the present races of animals and plants
since they were placed in their habitations on the
earth’s surface can have had any efficacy in producing
them at first. We are necessarily driven to assume,
as the beginning of the present cycle of organic nature, an event not included in the course of nature.
And we may remark that this necessity is the more
cogent, precisely because other cycles have preceded
the present.</p>
<p id="b10c3s8">8. <i>Nebular Origin of the Solar System.</i>&#8212;If we
attempt to apply the same antithesis of opinion (the
doctrines of Catastrophe and Uniformity) to the other
subjects of palætiological sciences, we shall be led to
similar conclusions. Thus, if we turn our attention to
Astronomical Palætiology, we perceive that the Nebular Hypothesis has a uniformitarian tendency. According to this hypothesis the formation of this our system
of sun, planets, and satellites, was a process of the same
kind as those which are still going on in the heavens.
One after another, nebulæ condense into separate
masses, which begin to revolve about each other by
mechanical necessity, and form systems of which our
solar system is a finished example. But we may remark, that the uniformitarian doctrine on this subject
rests on most unstable foundations. We have as yet
only very vague and imperfect reasonings to show that
by such condensation a <em>material</em> system such as ours
could result; and the introduction of <em>organized</em> beings
into such a material system is utterly out of the reach
of our philosophy. Here again, therefore, we are led
to regard the present order of the world as pointing
towards an origin altogether of a different kind from
anything which our material science can grasp. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page295">295</a></span></p>
<p id="b10c3s9">9. <i>Origin of Languages.</i>&#8212;We may venture to say
that we should be led to the same conclusion once
more, if we were to take into our consideration those
palætiological sciences which are beyond the domain of
matter; for instance, the History of Languages. We
may explain many of the differences and changes which
we become acquainted with, by referring to the action
of causes of change which still operate. But what
glossologist will venture to declare that the efficacy of
such causes has been uniform;&#8212;that the influences
which mould a language, or make one language differ
from others of the same stock, operated formerly with
no more efficacy than they exercise now. ‘Where,’
as has elsewhere been asked, ‘do we now find a language in the process of formation, unfolding itself in
inflexions, terminations, changes of vowels by grammatical relations, such as characterise the oldest known
languages?’ Again, as another proof how little the
history of languages suggests to the philosophical glossologist the persuasion of a uniform action of the causes
of change, I may refer to the conjecture of Dr. Prichard, that the varieties of language produced by the
separation of one stock into several, have been greater
and greater as we go backwards in history:&#8212;that<a id="fnanchor17-10" href="#note17-10"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> the
formation of sister dialects from a common language
(as the Scandinavian, German, and Saxon dialects from
the Teutonic, or the Gaelic, Erse and Welsh from the
Celtic) belongs to the first millennium before the
Christian era; while the formation of cognate languages of the same family, as the Sanskrit, Latin,
Greek and Gothic, must be placed at least two thousand years before that era; and at a still earlier period
took place the separation of the great families themselves, the Indo-European, Semitic, and others, in
which it is now difficult to trace the features of a
common origin. No hypothesis except one of this
kind will explain the existence of the families, groups,
and dialects of languages, which we find in existence.
Yet this is an entirely different view from that which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page296">296</a></span> the hypothesis of the uniform progress of change would
give. And thus, in the earliest stages of man’s career,
the revolutions of language must have been, even by
the evidence of the theoretical history of language
itself, of an order altogether different from any which
have taken place within the recent history of man.
And we may add, that as the early stages of the progress of language must have been widely different from
those later ones of which we can in some measure trace
the natural causes, we cannot place the origin of language in any point of view in which it comes under
the jurisdiction of natural causation at all.</p>

<p id="b10c3s10">10. <i>No Natural Origin discoverable.</i>&#8212;We are thus
led by a survey of several of the palætiological sciences
to a confirmation of the principle formerly asserted<a id="fnanchor18-10" href="#note18-10"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a>,
That in no palætiological science has man been able to
arrive at a beginning which is homogeneous with the
known course of events. We can in such sciences
often go very far back;&#8212;determine many of the remote circumstances of the past series of events;&#8212;ascend
to a point which seems to be near the origin;&#8212;and
limit the hypotheses respecting the origin itself: but
philosophers never have demonstrated, and, so far as
we can judge, probably never will be able to demonstrate, what was that primitive state of things from
which the progressive course of the world took its first
departure. In all these paths of research, when we
travel far backwards, the aspect of the earlier portions
becomes very different from that of the advanced part
on which we now stand; but in all cases the path is
lost in obscurity as it is traced backwards towards its
starting-point: it becomes not only invisible, but unimaginable; it is not only an interruption, but an
abyss, which interposes itself between us and any intelligible beginning of things.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br/><br/>
<span class="sc">Of the Relation of Tradition to Palætiology.</span></h3>
</div>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p id="b10c4s1">1. <i>Importance of Tradition.</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">Since</span> the Palætiological Sciences have it for their business to study
the train of past events produced by natural causes
down to the present time, the knowledge concerning such events which is supplied by the remembrance and records of man, in whatever form, must
have an important bearing upon these sciences. All
changes in the condition and extent of land and
sea, which have taken place within man’s observation,
all effects of deluges, sea-waves, rivers, springs, volcanoes, earthquakes, and the like, which come within the
reach of human history, have a strong interest for the
palætiologist. Nor is he less concerned in all recorded instances of the modification of the forms and
habits of plants and animals, by the operations of man,
or by transfer from one land to another. And when
we come to the Palætiology of Language, of Art, of
Civilization, we find our subject still more closely connected with history; for in truth these are historical,
no less than palætiological investigations. But, confining ourselves at present to the material sciences, we
may observe that though the importance of the information which tradition gives us, in the sciences now
under our consideration, as, for instance, geology, has
long been tacitly recognised; yet it is only recently
that geologists have employed themselves in collecting
their historical facts upon such a scale and with such
comprehensive views as are required by the interest
and use of collections of this kind. The Essay of Von <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page298">298</a></span> Hoff<a id="fnanchor19-10" href="#note19-10"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>, <i>On the Natural Alterations in the Surface of the
Earth which are proved by Tradition</i>, was the work
which first opened the eyes of geologists to the extent
and importance of this kind of investigation. Since
that time the same path of research has been pursued
with great perseverance by others, especially by Sir
C. Lyell; and is now justly considered as an essential
portion of Geology.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-10" href="#fnanchor19-10">19</a></span> Vol. i. 1822; vol. ii. 1824.</div>
<p id="b10c4s2">2. <i>Connexion of Tradition and Science.</i>&#8212;Events
which we might naturally expect to have some bearing
on geology, are narrated in the historical writings
which, even on mere human grounds, have the
strongest claim to our respect as records of the early
history of the world, and are confirmed by the traditions of various nations all over the globe; namely,
the formation of the earth and of its population, and a
subsequent deluge. It has been made a matter of controversy how the narrative of these events is to be
understood, so as to make it agree with the facts which
an examination of the earth’s surface and of its vegetable and animal population discloses to us. Such
controversies, when they are considered as merely
archæological, may occur in any of the palætiological
sciences. We may have to compare and to reconcile
the evidence of existing phenomena with that of
historical tradition. But under some circumstances
this process of conciliation may assume an interest of
another kind, on which we will make a few remarks.</p>
<p id="b10c4s3">3. <i>Natural and Providential History of the World.</i>&#8212;We may contemplate the existence of man upon the
earth, his origin and his progress, in the same manner
as we contemplate the existence of any other race of
animals; namely, in a purely palætiological view. We
may consider how far our knowledge of laws of causation enables us to explain his diffusion and migration,
his differences and resemblances, his actions and works.
And this is the view of man as a member of the
<em>Natural</em> Course of Things. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page299">299</a></span></p>
<p>But man, at the same time the contemplator and
the subject of his own contemplation, endowed with
faculties and powers which make him a being of a
different nature from other animals, cannot help regarding his own actions and enjoyments, his recollections and his hopes, under an aspect quite different
from any that we have yet had presented to us. We
have been endeavouring to place in a clear light the
Fundamental Ideas, such as that of Cause, on which
depends our knowledge of the natural course of things.
But there are other Ideas to which man necessarily
refers his actions; he is led by his nature, not only to
consider his own actions, and those of his fellow-men,
as springing out of this or that cause, leading to this
or that material result; but also as <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>, as
what they <i>ought</i> or <i>ought not</i> to be. He has Ideas
of moral relations as well as those Ideas of material
relations with which we have hitherto been occupied.
He is a moral as well as a natural agent.</p>
<p>Contemplating himself and the world around him
by the light of his Moral Ideas, man is led to the conviction that his moral faculties were bestowed upon him
by design and for a purpose; that he is the subject of
a Moral Government; that the course of the world is
directed by the Power which governs it, to the unfolding and perfecting of man’s moral nature; that this
guidance may be traced in the career of individuals
and of the world; that there is a <em>Providential</em> as well
as a Natural Course of Things.</p>
<p>Yet this view is beset by no small difficulties. The
full development of man’s moral faculties;&#8212;the perfection of his nature up to the measure of his own
ideas;&#8212;the adaptation of his moral being to an ultimate
destination, by its transit through a world full of moral
evil, in which evil each person has his share;&#8212;are
effects for which the economy of the world appears to
contain no adequate provision. Man, though aware of
his moral nature, and ready to believe in an ultimate
destination of purity and blessedness, is too feeble to
resist the temptation of evil, and too helpless to restore
his purity when once lost. He cannot but look for <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page300">300</a></span> some confirmation of that providential order which he
has begun to believe; some provision for those deficiencies in his moral condition which he has begun to feel.</p>
<p>He looks at the history of the world, and he finds
that at a certain period it offers to him the promise of
what he seeks. When the natural powers of man had
been developed to their full extent, and were beginning
to exhibit symptoms of decay;&#8212;when the intellectual
progress of the world appeared to have reached its
limit, without supplying man’s moral needs;&#8212;we find
the great Epoch in the Providential History of the
world. We find the announcement of a Dispensation
by which man’s deficiencies shall be supplied and his
aspirations fulfilled: we find a provision for the purification, the support, and the ultimate beatification of
those who use the provided means. And thus the
providential course of the world becomes consistent
and intelligible.</p>
<p id="b10c4s4">4. <i>The Sacred Narrative.</i>&#8212;But with the new Dispensation, we receive, not only an account of its own
scheme and history, but also a written narrative of
the providential course of the world from the earliest
times, and even from its first creation. This narrative
is recognized and authorized by the new dispensation,
and accredited by some of the same evidences as the
dispensation itself. That the existence of such a sacred
narrative should be a part of the providential order
of things, cannot but appear natural; but, naturally
also, the study of it leads to some difficulties.</p>
<p>The Sacred Narrative in some of its earliest portions
speaks of natural objects and occurrences respecting
them. In the very beginning of the course of the
world, we may readily believe (indeed, as we have seen
in the last chapter, our scientific researches lead us to
believe) that such occurrences were very different from
anything which now takes place;&#8212;different to an
extent and in a manner which we cannot estimate.
Now the narrative must speak of objects and occurrences in the words and phrases which have derived
their meaning from their application to the existing
natural state of things. When applied to an initial <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page301">301</a></span> supernatural state therefore, these words and phrases
cannot help being to us obscure and mysterious, perhaps
ambiguous and seemingly contradictory.</p>
<p id="b10c4s5">5. <i>Difficulties in interpreting the Sacred Narrative.</i>&#8212;The moral and providential relations of man’s condition
are so much more important to him than mere natural
relations, that at first we may well suppose he will
accept the Sacred Narrative, as not only unquestionable in its true import, but also as a guide in his views
even of mere natural things. He will try to modify
the conceptions which he entertains of objects and
their properties, so that the Sacred Narrative of the
supernatural condition shall retain the first meaning
which he had put upon it in virtue of his own habits
in the usage of language.</p>
<p>But man is so constituted that he cannot persist in
this procedure. The powers and tendencies of his intellect are such that he cannot help trying to attain true
conceptions of objects and their properties by the study
of things themselves. For instance, when he at first
read of a firmament dividing the waters above from the
waters below, he perhaps conceived a transparent floor
in the skies, on which the superior waters rested, which
descend in rain; but as his observations and his reasonings satisfied him that such a floor could not exist, he
became willing to allow (as St. Augustine allowed) that
the waters above the firmament are in a state of vapour.
And in like manner in other subjects, men, as their
views of nature became more distinct and precise,
modified, so far as it was necessary for consistency’s
sake, their first rude interpretations of the Sacred
Narrative; so that, without in any degree losing its
import as a view of the providential course of the
world, it should be so conceived as not to contradict
what they knew of the natural order of things.</p>
<p>But this accommodation was not always made without painful struggles and angry controversies. When
men had conceived the occurrences of the Sacred Narrative in a particular manner, they could not readily
and willingly adopt a new mode of conception; and all
attempts to recommend to them such novelties, they <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page302">302</a></span> resisted as attacks upon the sacredness of the Narrative. They had clothed their belief of the workings
of Providence in certain images; and they clung to
those images with the persuasion that, without them,
their belief could not subsist. Thus they imagined to
themselves that the earth was a flat floor, solidly and
broadly laid for the convenience of man; and they felt
as if the kindness of Providence was disparaged, when
it was maintained that the earth was a globe held together only by the mutual attraction of its parts.</p>
<p>The most memorable instance of a struggle of this
kind is to be found in the circumstances which attended
the introduction of the Heliocentric Theory of Copernicus to general acceptance. On this controversy I
have already made some remarks in the <i>History of
Science</i><a id="fnanchor20-10" href="#note20-10"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a>, and have attempted to draw from it some
lessons which may be useful to us when any similar
conflict of opinions may occur. I will here add a few
reflections with a similar view.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-10" href="#fnanchor20-10">20</a></span> B. v. c. iii. sect. 4.</div>
<p id="b10c4s6">6. <i>Such difficulties inevitable.</i>&#8212;In the first place, I
remark that such modifications of the current interpretation of the words of Scripture appear to be an
inevitable consequence of the progressive character of
Natural Science. Science is constantly teaching us to
describe known facts in new language; but the language of Scripture is always the same. And not only
so, but the language of Scripture is necessarily adapted
to the common state of man’s intellectual development,
in which he is supposed not to be possessed of science.
Hence the phrases used by Scripture are precisely those
which science soon teaches man to consider as inaccurate. Yet they are not, on that account, the less
fitted for their proper purpose: for if any terms had
been used, adapted to a more advanced state of knowledge, they must have been unintelligible among those
to whom the Scripture was first addressed. If the
Jews had been told that water existed in the clouds in
small drops, they would have marvelled that it did <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page303">303</a></span> not constantly descend; and to have explained the
reason of this, would have been to teach Atmology in
the sacred writings. If they had read in their Scripture that the earth was a sphere, when it appeared
to be a plain, they would only have been disturbed
in their thoughts or driven to some wild and baseless imaginations, by a declaration to them so strange.
If the Divine Speaker, instead of saying that he would
set his bow in the clouds, had been made to declare
that he would give to water the property of refracting different colours at different angles, how utterly
unmeaning to the hearers would the words have been!
And in these cases, the expressions, being unintelligible, startling, and bewildering, would have been such
as tended to unfit the Sacred Narrative for its place in
the providential dispensation of the world.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the great controversy which took
place in Galileo’s time between the defenders of the
then customary interpretations of Scripture, and the
assertors of the Copernican system of the universe,
when the innovators were upbraided with maintaining opinions contrary to Scripture, they replied that
Scripture was not intended to teach men astronomy,
and that it expressed the acts of divine power in
images which were suited to the ideas of unscientific
men. To speak of the rising and setting and travelling
of the sun, of the fixity and of the foundations of the
earth, was to use the only language which would have
made the Sacred Narrative intelligible. To extract
from these and the like expressions doctrines of science, was, they declared, in the highest degree unjustifiable; and such a course could lead, they held, to no
result but a weakening of the authority of Scripture
in proportion as its credit was identified with that of
these modes of applying it. And this judgment has
since been generally assented to by those who most
reverence and value the study of the designs of Providence as well as that of the works of nature.</p>
<p id="b10c4s7">7. <i>Science tells us nothing concerning Creation.</i>&#8212;Other apparent difficulties arise from the accounts
given in the Scripture of the first origin of the world <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page304">304</a></span> in which we live: for example, Light is represented as
created before the Sun. With regard to difficulties of
this kind, it appears that we may derive some instruction from the result to which we were led in the last
chapter;&#8212;namely, that in the sciences which trace the
progress of natural occurrences, we can in no case go
back to an origin, but in every instance appear to find
ourselves separated from it by a state of things, and an
order of events, of a kind altogether different from
those which come under our experience. The thread
of induction respecting the natural course of the
world snaps in our fingers, when we try to ascertain
where its beginning is. Since, then, science can teach
us nothing positive respecting the beginning of things,
she can neither contradict nor confirm what is taught
by Scripture on that subject; and thus, as it is unworthy timidity in the lover of Scripture to fear contradiction, so is it ungrounded presumption to look for
confirmation, in such cases. The providential history
of the world has its own beginning, and its own
evidence; and we can only render the system insecure, by making it lean on our material sciences. If
any one were to suggest that the nebular hypothesis
countenances the Scripture history of the formation of
this system, by showing how the luminous matter of
the sun might exist previous to the sun itself, we
should act wisely in rejecting such an attempt to
weave together these two heterogeneous threads;&#8212;the
one a part of a providential scheme, the other a fragment of a physical speculation.</p>
<p>We shall best learn those lessons of the true philosophy of science which it is our object to collect, by
attending to portions of science which have gone through
such crises as we are now considering; nor is it requisite, for this purpose, to bring forwards any subjects
which are still under discussion. It may, however, be
mentioned that such maxims as we are now endeavouring to establish, and the one before us in particular, bear with a peculiar force upon those Palætiological Sciences of which we have been treating in the
present Book. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page305">305</a></span></p>
<p id="b10c4s8">8. <i>Scientific views, when familiar, do not disturb
the authority of Scripture.</i>&#8212;There is another reflection
which may serve to console and encourage us in the
painful struggles which thus take place, between those
who maintain interpretations of Scripture already prevalent and those who contend for such new ones as the
new discoveries of science require. It is this;&#8212;that
though the new opinion is resisted by one party as
something destructive of the credit of Scripture and
the reverence which is its due, yet, in fact, when the
new interpretation has been generally established and
incorporated with men’s current thoughts, it ceases to
disturb their views of the authority of the Scripture or
of the truth of its teaching. When the language of
Scripture, invested with its new meaning, has become
familiar to men, it is found that the ideas which it
calls up are quite as reconcileable as the former ones
were, with the most entire acceptance of the providential dispensation. And when this has been found
to be the case, all cultivated persons look back with
surprise at the mistake of those who thought that the
essence of the revelation was involved in their own
arbitrary version of some collateral circumstance in the
revealed narrative. At the present day, we can hardly
conceive how reasonable men could ever have imagined
that religious reflections on the stability of the earth,
and the beauty and use of the luminaries which revolve
round it, would be interfered with by an acknowledgment that this rest and motion are apparent only<a id="fnanchor21-10" href="#note21-10"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a>.
And thus the authority of revelation is not shaken by
any changes introduced by the progress of science in the
mode of interpreting expressions which describe physical objects and occurrences; provided the new interpretation is admitted at a proper season, and in a
proper spirit; so as to soften, as much as possible, both
the public controversies and the private scruples which
almost inevitably accompany such an alteration.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-10" href="#fnanchor21-10">21</a></span> I have here borrowed a sentence or two from my own <i>History</i>.</div>
<p id="b10c4s9">9. <i>When should old Interpretations be given up?</i>&#8212;But the question then occurs, What is the proper <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page306">306</a></span> season for a religious and enlightened commentator to
make such a change in the current interpretation of
sacred Scripture? At what period ought the established exposition of a passage to be given up, and a
new mode of understanding the passage, such as is,
or seems to be, required by new discoveries respecting
the laws of nature, accepted in its place? It is plain,
that to introduce such an alteration lightly and hastily
would be a procedure fraught with inconvenience; for
if the change were made in such a manner, it might be
afterwards discovered that it had been adopted without sufficient reason, and that it was necessary to
reinstate the old exposition. And the minds of the
readers of Scripture, always to a certain extent and
for a time disturbed by the subversion of their long-established notions, would be distressed without any
need, and might be seriously unsettled. While, on
the other hand, a too protracted and obstinate resistance to the innovation, on the part of the scriptural
expositors, would tend to identify, at least in the
minds of many, the authority of the Scripture with the
truth of the exposition; and therefore would bring discredit upon the revealed word, when the established
interpretation was finally proved to be untenable.</p>
<p>A rule on this subject, propounded by some of the
most enlightened dignitaries of the Roman Catholic
church, on the occasion of the great Copernican controversy begun by Galileo, seems well worthy of our
attention. The following was the opinion given by
Cardinal Bellarmine at the time:&#8212;‘When a <em>demonstration</em> shall be found to establish the earth’s motion,
it will be proper to interpret the sacred Scriptures
otherwise than they have hitherto been interpreted in
those passages where mention is made of the stability
of the earth and movement of the heavens.’ This
appears to be a judicious and reasonable maxim for
such cases in general. So long as the supposed scientific discovery is doubtful, the exposition of the meaning of Scripture given by commentators of established
credit is not wantonly to be disturbed: but when a
scientific theory, irreconcileable with this ancient <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page307">307</a></span> interpretation, is clearly proved, we must give up the
interpretation, and seek some new mode of understanding the passage in question, by means of which it
may be consistent with what we know; for if it be not,
our conception of the things so described is no longer
consistent with itself.</p>
<p>It may be said that this rule is indefinite, for who
shall decide when a new theory is completely demonstrated, and the old interpretation become untenable?
But to this we may reply, that if the rule be assented
to, its application will not be very difficult. For when
men have admitted as a general rule, that the current interpretations of scriptural expressions respecting
natural objects and events may possibly require, and
in some cases certainly will require, to be abandoned,
and new ones admitted, they will hardly allow themselves to contend for such interpretations as if they
were essential parts of revelation; and will look upon
the change of exposition, whether it come sooner or
later, without alarm or anger. And when men lend
themselves to the progress of truth in this spirit, it is
not of any material importance at what period a new
and satisfactory interpretation of the scriptural difficulty is found; since a scientific exactness in our
apprehension of the meaning of such passages as are
now referred to is very far from being essential to our
full acceptance of revelation.</p>
<p id="b10c4s10">10. <i>In what Spirit should the Change be accepted?</i>&#8212;Still these revolutions in scriptural interpretation
must always have in them something which distresses
and disturbs religious communities. And such uneasy
feelings will take a different shape, according as the
community acknowledges or rejects a paramount interpretative authority in its religious leaders. In the
case in which the interpretation of the Church is
binding upon all its members, the more placid minds
rest in peace upon the ancient exposition, till the
spiritual authorities announce that the time for the
adoption of a new view has arrived; but in these circumstances, the more stirring and inquisitive minds,
which cannot refrain from the pursuit of new truths <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page308">308</a></span> and exact conceptions, are led to opinions which, being
contrary to those of the Church, are held to be sinful.
On the other hand, if the religious constitution of the
community allow and encourage each man to study
and interpret for himself the Sacred Writings, we are
met by evils of another kind. In this case, although,
by the unforced influence of admired commentators,
there may prevail a general agreement in the usual
interpretation of difficult passages, yet as each reader
of the Scripture looks upon the sense which he has
adopted as being his own interpretation, he maintains
it, not with the tranquil acquiescence of one who has
deposited his judgment in the hands of his Church,
but with the keenness and strenuousness of self-love.
In such a state of things, though no judicial severities
can be employed against the innovators, there may
arise more angry controversies than in the other case.</p>
<p>It is impossible to overlook the lesson which here
offers itself, that it is in the highest degree unwise in
the friends of religion, whether individuals or communities, unnecessarily to embark their credit in expositions of Scripture on matters which appertain to natural Science. By delivering physical doctrines as the
teaching of revelation, religion may lose much, but
cannot gain anything. This maxim of practical wisdom has often been urged by Christian writers. Thus
St. Augustine says<a id="fnanchor22-10" href="#note22-10"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a>: ‘In obscure matters and things
far removed from our senses, if we read anything, even
in the divine Scripture, which may produce diverse
opinions without damaging the faith which we cherish,
let us not rush headlong by positive assertion to either
the one opinion or the other; lest, when a more
thorough discussion has shown the opinion which we
had adopted to be false, our faith may fall with it:
and we should be found contending, not for the doctrine of the sacred Scriptures, but for our own; endeavouring to make our doctrine to be that of the Scriptures, instead of taking the doctrine of the Scriptures
to be ours.’ And in nearly the same spirit, at the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page309">309</a></span> time of the Copernican controversy, it was thought
proper to append to the work of Copernicus a postil,
to say that the work was written to account for the
phenomena, and that people must not run on blindly
and condemn either of the opposite opinions. Even
when the Inquisition, in 1616, thought itself compelled
to pronounce a decision upon this subject, the verdict
was delivered in very moderate language;&#8212;that ‘the
doctrine of the earth’s motion appeared to be contrary
to Scripture:’ and yet, moderate as this expression is,
it has been blamed by judicious members of the Roman
church as deciding a point such as religious authorities
ought not to pretend to decide; and has brought upon
that church no ordinary weight of general condemnation. Kepler pointed out, in his lively manner, the
imprudence of employing the force of religious authorities on such subjects: <i>Acies dolabræ in ferrum illisa,
postea nec in lignum valet amplius. Capiat hoc cujus
interest</i>. ‘If you <em>will</em> try to chop iron, the axe becomes unable to cut even wood. I warn those whom
it concerns.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-10" href="#fnanchor22-10">22</a></span> Lib. i. <i>de Genesi</i>, cap. xviii.</div>
<p id="b10c4s11">11. <i>In what Spirit should the Change be urged?</i>&#8212;But while we thus endeavour to show in what manner
the interpreters of Scripture may most safely and most
properly accept the discoveries of science, we must not
forget that there may be errours committed on the
other side also; and that men of science, in bringing
forward views which may for a time disturb the minds
of lovers of Scripture, should consider themselves as
bound by strict rules of candour, moderation, and
prudence. Intentionally to make their supposed discoveries a means of discrediting, contradicting, or
slighting the sacred Scriptures, or the authority of
religion, is in them unpardonable. As men who make
the science of Truth the business of their lives, and are
persuaded of her genuine superiority, and certain of
her ultimate triumph, they are peculiarly bound to urge
her claims in a calm and temperate spirit; not forgetting that there are other kinds of truth besides that
which they peculiarly study. They may properly reject
authority in matters of science; but they are to leave <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page310">310</a></span> it its proper office in matters of religion. I may
here again quote Kepler’s expressions: ‘In Theology
we balance authorities, in Philosophy we weigh reasons. A holy man was Lactantius who denied that
the earth was round; a holy man was Augustine, who
granted the rotundity, but denied the antipodes; a
holy thing to me is the Inquisition, which allows the
smallness of the earth, but denies its motion; but more
holy to me is Truth; and hence I prove, from philosophy, that the earth is round, and inhabited on every
side, of small size, and in motion among the stars,&#8212;and this I do with no disrespect to the Doctors.’ I the
more willingly quote such a passage from Kepler, because the entire ingenuousness and sincere piety of his
character does not allow us to suspect him in anything
of hypocrisy or latent irony. That similar professions
of respect may be made ironically, we have a noted
example in the celebrated Introduction to <i>Galileo’s
Dialogue on the Copernican System</i>; probably the part
which was most offensive to the authorities. ‘Some
years ago,’ he begins, ‘a wholesome edict was promulgated at Rome, which, in order to check the perilous
scandals of the present age, imposed silence upon the
Pythagorean opinion of the mobility of the earth.
There were not wanting,’ he proceeds, ‘persons who
rashly asserted that this decree was the result, not of
a judicious inquiry, but of passion ill-informed; and
complaints were heard that councillors, utterly unacquainted with astronomical observation, ought not to
be allowed, with their sudden prohibitions, to clip
the wings of speculative intellects. <em>At the hearing of
rash lamentations like these, my zeal could not keep
silence.</em>’ And he then goes on to say, that he wishes,
in his <i>Dialogue</i>, to show that the subject had been
fully examined at Rome. Here the irony is quite transparent, and the sarcasm glaringly obvious. I think we
may venture to say that this is not the temper in
which scientific questions should be treated; although
by some, perhaps, the prohibition of public discussion
may be considered as justifying any evasion which is
likely to pass unpunished. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page311">311</a></span></p>
<p id="b10c4s12">12. <i>Duty of Mutual Forbearance.</i>&#8212;We may add,
as a further reason for mutual forbearance in such
cases, that the true interests of both parties are the
same. The man of science is concerned, no less than
any other person, in the truth and import of the
divine dispensation; the religious man, no less than
the man of science, is, by the nature of his intellect,
incapable of believing two contradictory declarations.
Hence they have both alike a need for understanding
the Scripture in some way in which it shall be consistent with their understanding of nature. It is for
their common advantage to conciliate, as Kepler says,
the finger and the tongue of God, his works and his
word. And they may find abundant reason to bear
with each other, even if they should adopt for this
purpose different interpretations, each finding one
satisfactory to himself; or if any one should decline
employing his thoughts on such subjects at all. I
have elsewhere<a id="fnanchor23-10" href="#note23-10"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> quoted a passage from Kepler<a id="fnanchor24-10" href="#note24-10"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a> which
appears to me written in a most suitable spirit: ‘I beseech my reader that, not unmindful of the divine
goodness bestowed upon man, he do with me praise
and celebrate the wisdom of the Creator, which I open
to him from a more inward explication of the form
of the world, from a searching of causes, from a detection of the errours of vision; and that thus not
only in the firmness and stability of the earth may we
perceive with gratitude the preservation of all living
things in nature as the gift of God: but also that in
its motion, so recondite, so admirable, we may acknowledge the wisdom of the Creator. But whoever is too
dull to receive this science, or too weak to believe the
Copernican system without harm to his piety, him,
I say, I advise that, leaving the school of astronomy,
and condemning, if so he please, any doctrines of the
philosophers, he follow his own path, and desist from
this wandering through the universe; and that, lifting up his natural eyes, with which alone he can see, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page312">312</a></span> he pour himself out from his own heart in worship
of God the Creator, being certain that he gives no
less worship to God than the astronomer, to whom
God has given to see more clearly with his inward
eyes, and who, from what he has himself discovered,
both can and will glorify God.’</p>

<p id="b10c4s13">13. <i>Case of Galileo.</i>&#8212;I may perhaps venture here
to make a remark or two upon this subject with reference to a charge brought against a certain portion
of the <i>History of the Inductive Sciences</i>. Complaint
has been made<a id="fnanchor25-10" href="#note25-10"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> that the character of the Roman
church, as shown in its behaviour towards Galileo, is
misrepresented in the account given of it in the History of Astronomy. It is asserted that Galileo provoked the condemnation he incurred; first, by pertinaciously demanding the assent of the ecclesiastical
authorities to his opinion of the consistency of the
Copernican doctrine with Scripture; and afterwards by
contumaciously, and, as we have seen, contumeliously
violating the silence which the Church had enjoined
upon him. It is further declared that the statement
which represents it as the habit of the Roman church
to dogmatize on points of natural science is unfounded;
as well as the opinion that in consequence of this
habit, new scientific truths were promulgated less
boldly in Italy than in other countries. I shall reply
very briefly on these subjects; for the decision of them
is by no means requisite in order to establish the doctrines to which I have been led in the present chapter,
nor, I hope, to satisfy my reader that my views have
been collected from an impartial consideration of scientific history.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-10" href="#fnanchor25-10">25</a></span> <i>Dublin Review</i>, No. ix. July, 1838, p. 72.</div>
<p>With regard to Galileo, I do not think it can be
denied that he obtruded his opinions upon the ecclesiastical authorities in an unnecessary and imprudent
manner. He was of an ardent character, strongly
convinced himself, and urged on still more by the conviction which he produced among his disciples, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page313">313</a></span> thus he became impatient for the triumph of truth.
This judgment of him has recently been delivered by
various independent authorities, and has undoubtedly
considerable foundation<a id="fnanchor26-10" href="#note26-10"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a>. As to the question whether
authority in matters of natural science were habitually
claimed by the authorities of the Church of Rome, I
have to allow that I cannot produce instances which
establish such a habit. We, who have been accustomed
to have daily before our eyes the Monition which the
Romish editors of Newton thought it necessary to
prefix&#8212;<i>Cæterum latis a summo Pontifice contra telluris motum Decretis, nos obsequi profitemur</i>&#8212;were not
likely to conjecture that this was a solitary instance of
the interposition of the Papal authority on such subjects. But although it would be easy to find declarations of heresy delivered by Romish Universities, and
writers of great authority, against tenets belonging to
the natural sciences, I am not aware that any other
case can be adduced in which the Church or the Pope
can be shown to have pronounced such a sentence.
I am well contented to acknowledge this; for I should
be far more gratified by finding myself compelled to
hold up the seventeenth century as a model for the
nineteenth in this respect, than by having to sow
enmity between the admirers of the past and the
present through any disparaging contrast<a id="fnanchor27-10" href="#note27-10"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-10" href="#fnanchor26-10">26</a></span> Besides the <i>Dublin Review</i>, I may
quote the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, which
I suppose will not be thought likely
to have a bias in favour of the exercise of ecclesiastical authority in
matters of science; though certainly
there is a puerility in the critic’s
phraseology which does not add to
the weight of his judgment. ‘Galileo
contrived to surround the truth with
every variety of obstruction. The
tide of knowledge, which had hitherto advanced in peace, he crested with
angry breakers, and he involved in
its surf both his friends and his foes.’&#8212;<i>Ed. Rev.</i> No. cxxiii. p. 126.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-10" href="#fnanchor27-10">27</a></span> I may add that the most candid
of the adherents of the Church of
Rome condemn the assumption of
authority in matters of science, made,
in this one instance at least, by the
ecclesiastical tribunals. The author
of the <i>Ages of Faith</i> (book viii. p.
248), says, ‘A Congregation, it is to be
lamented, declared the new system to
be opposed to Scripture, and therefore heretical.’</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page314">314</a></span> With respect to the attempt made in my History to
characterize the intellectual habits of Italy as produced
by her religious condition,&#8212;certainly it would ill become any student of the history of science to speak
slightingly of that country, always the mother of sciences, always ready to catch the dawn and hail the
rising of any new light of knowledge. But I think
our admiration of this activity and acuteness of mind
is by no means inconsistent with the opinion, that new
truths were promulgated more boldly beyond the Alps,
and that the subtilty of the Italian intellect loved to
insinuate what the rough German bluntly asserted.
Of the decent duplicity with which forbidden opinions
were handled, the reviewer himself gives us instances,
when he boasts of the liberality with which Copernican
professors were placed in important stations by the
ecclesiastical authorities, soon after the doctrine of the
motion of the earth had been declared by the same authorities to be contrary to Scripture. And in the same
spirit is the process of demanding from Galileo a public and official recantation of opinions which he had
repeatedly been told by his ecclesiastical superiors he
might hold as much as he pleased. I think it is easy
to believe that among persons so little careful to reconcile public profession with private conviction, official
decorum was all that was demanded. When Galileo
had made his renunciation of the earth’s motion on his
knees, he rose and said, as we are told, <i>E pur si muove</i>&#8212;‘and yet it <em>does</em> move.’ This is sometimes represented as the heroic soliloquy of a mind cherishing its
conviction of the truth, in spite of persecution; I
think we may more naturally conceive it uttered as a
playful epigram in the ear of a cardinal’s secretary,

<p>Besides the Ideas involved in the material sciences, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page315">315</a></span> of which we have already examined the principal ones,
there is one Idea or Conception which our Sciences do
not indeed include, but to which they not obscurely
point; and the importance of this Idea will make it
proper to speak of it, though this must be done very

<span class="sc">Of the Conception of a First Cause.</span></h3>

<p class="noind" id="b10c5s1">
<span class="dropcap"><span class="dsmall">1.</span> A</span>T
the end of the last chapter but one, we were
led to this result,&#8212;that we cannot, in any
of the Palætiological Sciences, ascend to a beginning
which is of the same nature as the existing cause of
events, and which depends upon causes that are still in
operation. Philosophers never have demonstrated, and
probably never will be able to demonstrate, what
was the original condition of the solar system, of the
earth, of the vegetable and animal worlds, of languages,
of arts. On all these subjects the course of investigation, followed backwards as far as our materials allow
us to pursue it, ends at last in an impenetrable gloom.
We strain our eyes in vain when we try, by our natural
faculties, to discern an origin.</p>
<p id="b10c5s2">2. Yet speculative men have been constantly employed in attempts to arrive at that which thus seems
to be placed out of their reach. The Origin of
Languages, the Origin of the present Distribution of
Plants and Animals, the Origin of the Earth, have
been common subjects of diligent and persevering
inquiry. Indeed inquiries respecting such subjects
have been, at least till lately, the usual form which
Palætiological researches have assumed. <i>Cosmogony</i>,
the Origin of the World, of which, in such speculations,
the earth was considered as a principal part, has been
a favourite study both of ancient and of modern
times: and most of the attempts at Geology previous
to the present period have been <i>Cosmogonies</i> or <i>Geogonies</i>, rather than that more genuine science which
we have endeavoured to delineate. Again: Glossology,
though now an extensive body of solid knowledge, was <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page317">317</a></span> mainly brought into being by inquiries concerning the
Original Language spoken by men; and the nature of
the first separation and diffusion of languages, the first
peopling of the earth by man and by animals, were
long sought after with ardent curiosity, although of
course with reference to the authority of the Scriptures,
as well as the evidence of natural phenomena. Indeed
the interest of such inquiries even yet is far from being
extinguished. The disposition to explore the past in
the hope of finding, by the light of natural reasoning
as well as by the aid of revelation, the origin of the
present course of things, appears to be unconquerable.
‘What was the beginning?’ is a question which the
human race cannot desist from perpetually asking.
And no failure in obtaining a satisfactory answer can
prevent inquisitive spirits from again and again repeating the inquiry, although the blank abyss into which
it is uttered does not even return an echo.</p>
<p id="b10c5s3">3. What, then, is the reason of an attempt so pertinacious yet so fruitless? By what motive are we impelled thus constantly to seek what we can never find?
Why are the errour of our conjectures, the futility of
our reasonings, the precariousness of our interpretations, over and over again proved to us in vain? Why
is it impossible for us to acquiesce in our ignorance
and to relinquish the inquiry? Why cannot we content ourselves with examining those links of the chain
of causes which are nearest to us,&#8212;those in which the
connexion is intelligible and clear; instead of fixing
our attention upon those remote portions where we
can no longer estimate its coherence? In short, why
did not men from the first take for the subject of their
speculations the Course of Nature rather than the
Origin of Things?</p>
<p>To this we reply, that in doing what they have thus
done, in seeking what they have sought, men are impelled by an intellectual necessity. They cannot conceive a Series of connected occurrences without a Commencement; they cannot help supposing a cause for
the Whole, as well as a cause for each part; they cannot be satisfied with a succession of causes without <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page318">318</a></span> assuming a First Cause. Such an assumption is necessarily impressed upon our minds by our contemplation
of a series of causes and effects; that <em>there must be a
First Cause</em>, is accepted by all intelligent reasoners as
an Axiom: and like other Axioms, its truth is necessarily implied in the Idea which it involves.</p>
<p id="b10c5s4">4. The evidence of this axiom may be illustrated in
several ways. In the first place, the axiom is assumed
in the argument usually offered to prove the existence
of the Deity. Since, it is said, the world now exists,
and since nothing cannot produce something, something must have existed from eternity. This Something is the First Cause: it is God.</p>
<p>Now what I have to remark here is this:&#8212;the conclusiveness of this argument, as a proof of the existence
of one independent, immutable Deity, depends entirely
upon the assumption of the axiom above stated. The
World, a <span class="correction" title="emended from serious">series</span> of causes and effects, exists: therefore
there must be, not only this series of causes and effects,
but also a First Cause. It will be easily seen, that
without the axiom, that in every series of causes and
effects there must be a First Cause, the reasoning is
altogether inconclusive.</p>
<p id="b10c5s5">5. Or to put the matter otherwise: The argument
for the existence of the Deity was stated thus: Something exists, therefore something must have existed
from eternity. ‘Granted,’ the opponent might say;
‘but this something which has existed from eternity,
why may it not be this very series of causes and effects
which is now going on, and which appears to contain
in itself no indication of beginning or end?’ And
thus, without the assumption of the necessity of a
First Cause, the force of the argument may be resisted.</p>
<p id="b10c5s6">6. But, it may be asked, how do those who have
written to prove the existence of the Deity reply to
such an objection as the one just stated? It is natural
to suppose that, on a subject so interesting and so long
discussed, all the obvious arguments with their replies,
have been fully brought into view. What is the result in this case? <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page319">319</a></span></p>
<p>The principal modes of replying to the above objection, that the series of causes and effects which now
exists, may have existed from eternity, appear to be
these.</p>
<p>In the first place, our minds cannot be satisfied with
a series of successive, dependent, causes and effects,
without something first and independent. We pass
from effect to cause, and from that to a higher cause,
in search of something on which the mind can rest;
but if we can do nothing but repeat this process, there
is no use in it. We move our limbs, but make no
advance. Our question is not answered, but evaded.
The mind cannot acquiesce in the destiny thus presented to it, of being referred from event to event,
from object to object, along an interminable vista of
causation and time. Now this mode of stating the
reply,&#8212;to say that the mind <em>cannot thus be satisfied</em>,
appears to be equivalent to saying that the mind is
conscious of a Principle, in virtue of which such a view
as this must be rejected;&#8212;the mind takes refuge in
the assumption of a First Cause, from an employment
inconsistent with its own nature.</p>
<p id="b10c5s7">7. Or again, we may avoid the objection, by putting the argument for the existence of a Deity in this
form: The series of causes and effects which we call
the <i>world</i>, or the <i>course of nature</i>, may be considered as
a <em>whole</em>, and this whole must have a cause of its existence. The whole collection of objects and events may
be comprehended as a single effect, and of this effect
there must be a cause. This Cause of the Universe
must be superior to, and independent of the special
events, which, happening in time, make up the universe of which He is the cause. He must exist and
exercise causation, before these events can begin: He
must be the First Cause.</p>
<p>Although the argument is here somewhat modified
in form, the substance is the same as before. For the
assumption that we may consider the whole series of
causes and effects as a <em>single effect</em>, is equivalent to the
assumption that besides partial causes we must have a
First Cause. And thus the Idea of a First Cause, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page320">320</a></span> the axiom which asserts its necessity, are recognized in
the usual argumentation on this subject.</p>
<p id="b10c5s8">8. This Idea of a First Cause, and the principle
involved in the Idea, have been the subject of discussion in another manner. As we have already said,
we assume as an axiom that a First Cause must exist;
and we assert that God, the First Cause, exists eternal and immutable, by the necessity which the axiom
implies. Hence God is said to exist necessarily;&#8212;to
be a necessarily existing being. And when this <em>necessary existence</em> of God had been spoken of, it soon began
to be contemplated as a sufficient reason, and as an absolute demonstration of His existence; without any
need of referring to the world as an effect, in order to
arrive at God as the cause. And thus men conceived
that they had obtained a proof of the existence of the
Deity, <i>à priori</i>, from Ideas, as well as <i>à posteriori</i>,
from Effects.</p>
<p id="b10c5s9">9. Thus, Thomas Aquinas employs this reasoning to prove the <em>eternity</em> of God<a id="fnanchor29-10" href="#note29-10"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a>: ‘Oportet ponere
aliquod primum necessarium quod est per se ipsum
necessarium; et hoc est Deus, cum sit prima causa
ut dictum est: igitur Deus æternus est, cum omne
necessarium per se sit æternum.’ It is true that the
schoolmen never professed to be able to prove the
<em>existence</em> of the Deity <i>à priori</i>: but they made use
of this conception of necessary existence in a manner
which approached very near to such an attempt. Thus
Suarez<a id="fnanchor30-10" href="#note30-10"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> discusses the question, ‘Utrum aliquo modo
possit <i>à priori</i> demonstrari Deum esse.’ And resolves
the question in this manner: ‘Ad hunc ergo modum
dicendum est: Demonstrato <i>à posteriori</i> Deum esse
ens necessarium et a se, ex hoc attributo posse <i>à
priori</i> demonstrari præter illud non posse esse aliud
ens necessarium et a se, et consequenter demonstrari
Deum esse.’</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-10" href="#fnanchor29-10">29</a></span> Aquin. <i>Cont. Gentil.</i> lib. i. c. xiv. p. 21.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-10" href="#fnanchor30-10">30</a></span> <i>Metaphys.</i> tom. ii. disp. xxix. sect. 3, p. 28.</div>
<p>But in modern times attempts were made by Descartes and Samuel Clarke, to prove the Divine <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page321">321</a></span> existence at once <i>à priori</i>, from the conception of necessary
existence; which, it was argued, could not subsist
without actual existence. This argumentation was
acutely and severely criticised by Dr. Waterland.</p>
<p id="b10c5s10">10. Without dwelling upon a subject, the discussion
of which does not enter into the design of the present
work, I may remark that the question whether an <i>à
priori</i> proof of the existence of a First Cause be possible, is a question concerning the nature of our Ideas,
and the evidence of the axioms which they involve,
of the same kind as many questions which we have
already had to discuss. Is our Conception or Idea
of a First Cause gathered from the effects we see
around us? It is plain that we must answer, here
as in other cases, that the Idea is not extracted from
the phenomena, but assumed in order that the phenomena may become intelligible to the mind;&#8212;that the
Idea is a necessary one, inasmuch as it does not depend
upon observation for its evidence; but that it depends
upon observation for its development, since without
some observation, we cannot conceive the mind to be
cognizant of the relation of causation at all. In this
respect, however, the Idea of a First Cause is no less
necessary than the ideas of Space, or Time, or Cause in
general. And whether we call the reasoning derived
from such a necessity an argument <i>à priori</i> or <i>à posteriori</i>, in either case it possesses the genuine character
of demonstration, being founded upon axioms which
command universal assent.</p>
<p id="b10c5s11">11. I have, however, spoken of our <i>Conception</i> rather than of our <i>Idea</i> of a First Cause; for the notion
of a First Cause appears to be rather a modification of
the Fundamental Idea of Cause, which was formerly
discussed, than a separate and peculiar Idea. And the
Axiom, <em>that there must be a First Cause</em>, is recognised
by most persons as an application of the general Axiom
of Causation, <em>that every effect must have a Cause</em>; this
latter Axiom being applied to the World, considered in
its totality, as a single Effect. This distinction, however, between an Idea and a Conception, is of no
material consequence to our argument; provided we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page322">322</a></span> allow the maxim, that there must be a First Cause, to
be necessarily and evidently true; whether it be thought
better to speak of it as an independent Axiom, or to
consider it as derived from the general Axiom of
Causation.</p>
<p id="b10c5s12">12. Thus we necessarily infer a First Cause, although
the Palætiological Sciences only point <em>towards</em> it, and
do not lead us <em>to</em> it. But I must observe further;
that in each of the series of events which form the subject of Palætiological research, the First Cause is the
<em>same</em>. Without here resting upon reasoning founded
upon our Conception of a First Cause, I may remark
that this identity is proved by the close connexion of all
the branches of natural science, and the way in which
the causes and the events of each are interwoven with
those which belong to the others. We must needs believe that the First Cause which produced the earth
and its atmosphere is also the Cause of the plants
which clothe its surface; that the First Cause of the
vegetable and of the animal world are the same; that
the First Cause which produced light produced also
eyes; that the First Cause which produced air and
organs of articulation produced also language and the
faculties by which language is rendered possible: and
if <em>those</em> faculties, then also all man’s other faculties;&#8212;the powers by which, as we have said, he discerns
right and wrong, and recognises a providential as
well as a natural course of things. Nor can we think
otherwise than that the Being who gave these faculties, bestowed them for some purpose;&#8212;bestowed
them for that purpose which alone is compatible with
their nature:&#8212;the purpose, namely, of guiding and
elevating man in his present career, and of preparing
him for another state of being to which they irresistibly direct his hopes. And thus, although, as we have
said, no one of the Palætiological Sciences can be
traced continuously to an Origin, yet they not only
each point to an Origin, but all to the same Origin.
Their lines are broken indeed, as they run backwards
into the early periods of the world, but yet they all
appear to converge to the same invisible point. And <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page323">323</a></span> this point, thus indicated by the natural course of
things, can be no other than that which is disclosed
to us as the starting-point of the providential course
of the world; for we are persuaded by such reasons
as have just been hinted, that the Creator of the
natural world can be no other than the Author
and Governor and Judge of the moral and spiritual
world.</p>
<p class="end" id="b10c5s13">13. Thus we are led, by our material Sciences, and
especially by the Palætiological class of them, to the
borders of a higher region, and to a point of view from
which we have a prospect of other provinces of knowledge;&#8212;to contemplations in which other faculties of
man are concerned besides his intellectual, other interests involved besides those of speculation. On these
it does not belong to our present plan to dwell: but
even such a brief glance as we have taken of the connexion of material with moral speculations may not
be useless, since it may serve to show that the principles of truth which we are now laboriously collecting among the results of the physical sciences, may
possibly find some application in those parts of knowledge towards which men most naturally look with
deeper interest and more serious reverence.</p>
<hr class="two" /><br/>
<p>We have been employed hitherto in examining the
materials of knowledge, Facts and Ideas;&#8212;Facts in
our former History, and Ideas in the present History.
We have dwelt at length on this latter element; inasmuch as the consideration of it is, on various accounts,
and especially at the present time, by far the most important, having hitherto been least distinctly attended
to as a special element of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>There still remains an important task, with a view
to which we have undertaken this survey of the past
course of human thought and discovery:&#8212;namely, the
task of determining the processes by which these materials may actually be made to constitute knowledge. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page324">324</a></span> We have surveyed the stones which lie before us, partly
built and partly ready for building: we have found
them exactly squared, and often curiously covered with
significant imagery and important inscriptions. We
have now to discover how they may best be fitted into
their places, and cemented together, so that rising stage
above stage, they may grow at last into that fair and
lofty temple of Truth, for which we cannot doubt that
they were intended by the Great Architect.</p>
<p class="end">This task, the description of the processes by which
Scientific Truth is discovered and established, we shall,
as has already been said, entitle, in reference to previous attempts of the same kind, <i>Novum Organum
Renovatum</i>.</p>

<p>Whewell published the first edition of the <i>Philosophy of the

appeared in 1847. The third editions saw a major reshaping of the
<i>Philosophy</i>: a two volume <i>History of Scientific Ideas</i>
(1858 - the present text, relying upon resources

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
